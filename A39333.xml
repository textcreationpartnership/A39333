            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>HE that will be a compleat Souldier, mu≈øt fir≈øt begin to learn the u≈øe of his <hi>Arms,</hi> laying that down in his thoughts for his fir≈øt foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this hath been the neglect of many in our times, who have ≈øtrived to know high thoughts in the <hi>Art Military,</hi> before they can well perform their <hi>Po≈øtures.</hi> Therefore, my advice ≈øhall be unto all ≈øuch that de≈øire to thrive in this Art, that they will not <hi>≈øoar</hi> too high: but fir≈øt learn the <hi>A, B, C</hi> thereof, after which they may proceed by degrees to pronounce to the Souldier with boldne≈øs their proficiency therein. He therefore that with ≈øafety, ea≈øe, and delight de≈øireth to handle his Arms, mu≈øt ≈øet times apart frequently to practi≈øe him≈øelf therein. And here I cannot but much blame the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of our <hi>Trained Bands in London,</hi> of two great neglects: The fir≈øt, in making men <hi>File-leaders</hi> either out of re≈øpect or favour they bear unto them, or el≈øe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe one man hath a better <hi>Buff-coat</hi> than another: I ≈øpeak not this to encourage any man to come ≈ølovenly habited when he ≈øhall march forth with his <hi>Captain,</hi> but rather advi≈øe all Souldiers to fit them≈øelves with the be≈øt array they can; and could wi≈øh all the <hi>Serjeants</hi> in drawing up their <hi>Files,</hi> to pitch upon ≈øuch Gentlemen to be <hi>File-leaders,</hi> as may take charge of his <hi>File,</hi> and ≈øhall be able, willing, and ready upon all convenient times, to in≈øtruct and teach his <hi>File</hi> in all their <hi>Po≈øtures,</hi> and neat handling of their <hi>Arms;</hi> which if carefully ob≈øerved, they would reap the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of much ea≈øe to them≈øelves and the private Souldiers: readine≈øs in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the <hi>Po≈øtures,</hi> would much redound to the honour of the Captain that ≈øhall lead them. But for the farther ≈øatisfaction of the ingenious Souldier that ≈øhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what <hi>Po≈øture</hi> is, I ≈øhall briefly re≈øolve them thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Po≈øture,</hi> as I conceive, is a <hi>garbe</hi> or <hi>figure</hi> that a man ≈øtands in, in the handling of his <hi>Arms;</hi> which he u≈øeth for the better grace and becoming of them.</p>
                     <p>There are ≈øeveral motions belonging to each <hi>Po≈øture,</hi> which ≈øome call <hi>Po≈øtures,</hi> but they much deceive them≈øelves, as ≈øhall appear clearly unto them (by the ≈øurvey) as they ≈øhall be ≈øet down in order. And fir≈øt, we will begin to ≈øet down the <hi>Po≈øtures</hi> of the <hi>Pike.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Several Rea≈øons why the <hi>Pike</hi> is the more honourable Arms.</head>
                     <p>FIr≈øt I ≈øhall begin to ≈øet down the <hi>po≈øtures</hi> of the <hi>Pike,</hi> before the <hi>po≈øtures</hi> of the <hi>Musket,</hi> for the≈øe rea≈øons following, as conceiving, Fir≈øt, They are the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Arms,</hi> in re≈øpect the <hi>Colours</hi> flying upon the head of them, and upon the drawing up of the Company there is the mo≈øt propere≈øt place for the <hi>Captain</hi> to be, either upon a Stand or upon a March, provided he have ground ≈øufficient to March them all abre≈øt. If upon a Stand the Captain ≈øhall have occa≈øion to engage again≈øt an Enemy, thither his Officers may repair unto him upon the head of the <hi>Pikes,</hi>
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:108706:4"/>
there to receive directions. And if the Captain ≈øhall cau≈øe the <hi>Serjeants</hi> to draw off part, or all the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> from the Body of <hi>Pikes</hi> to fire again≈øt the enemy, the Gentlemen of the <hi>Pikes</hi> in the mean time ≈øtand undauntedly to undergo the cruel ≈øhot of the Cannon from the contrary part for to pre≈øerve their Colours, who are likewi≈øe a place of <hi>Randezvous</hi> for the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to repair unto when they ≈øhall retreat from fight. Farther, it hath been the ambition of many Gentlemen, both in <hi>Holland, France,</hi> and in the≈øe our late unhappy Wars in <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>trail Pikes</hi> with ≈øeveral Commanders whom they ≈øhall think fit. And la≈øtly, to conclude all, that the <hi>Pike</hi> is the more honourable <hi>Arms,</hi> it is ≈øo in re≈øpect of antiquity; for there hath been the u≈øe of the <hi>Pike</hi> and <hi>Spear,</hi> many hundred years before there was any knowledge of the <hi>Musket,</hi> as in many Hi≈øtories you ≈øhall find. And ≈øo for pre≈øent I will conclude this di≈øcour≈øe of the <hi>Pike,</hi> de≈øiring the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to have a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cen≈øure of me: for I intend not by it to per≈øwade all Souldiers to the handling of the <hi>Pike,</hi> and none to be <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> for that cannot be; I ≈øhould rather advi≈øe all <hi>Captains</hi> that have occa≈øion to rai≈øe their Companies, to have two thirds of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers,</hi> and but one of <hi>Pikes:</hi> that is to ≈øay, if they ≈øhould have 18 <hi>Files,</hi> to cau≈øe twelve of them to carry <hi>Muskets,</hi> and the other ≈øix <hi>files Pikes.</hi> And in my judgment they ≈øhall perform the better ≈øervice unto any Nation where they ≈øhall be employ'd: and I ≈øhall farther de≈øire the Souldiers (e≈øpecially tho≈øe that be of <hi>low</hi> ≈øtature) to handle and take delight in the u≈øe of the <hi>Musket;</hi> for it is an exceeding great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him ≈øo to handle his <hi>Musket,</hi> as that he doth it with ea≈øe, and in a comely manner; and he that ≈øhall become expert therein, I have often ob≈øerved this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to follow him, by the report of others; Such a one is a good <hi>Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi> and an able Souldier: concluding thereby, he that will take the pains to be a good <hi>Muskettier,</hi> certainly cannot be idle, but hath gained ≈øomething more to make him capable of ≈øuch prai≈øe. To conclude, I ≈øhall de≈øire the Gentlemen of the <hi>Pikes</hi> and the Gentlemen of the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to go hand in hand in love like dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and neither of them to envy each other; and in ≈øo doing, God will give a ble≈ø≈øing to their undertakings. But now fearing I have dwelt too long upon this di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe of the <hi>Arms,</hi> I ≈øhall next proceed to ≈øet down, fir≈øt the <hi>po≈øtures</hi> of the <hi>Pike,</hi> then the <hi>po≈øtures</hi> of the <hi>Musket,</hi> with all the words of <hi>command</hi> tending to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; after collect them in order in a <hi>brief</hi> way, and then ≈øet forth unto you the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of <hi>number</hi> that the one <hi>Arms</hi> hath with the other in the <hi>po≈øtures,</hi> as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

This way of charging to the <hi>Hor≈øe,</hi> I have ≈øet down, as being practi≈øed ≈øometimes among≈øt us in our private Meetings; but I conceive it to be of little u≈øe to receive a de≈øperate charge of the <hi>Hor≈øe,</hi> for by the≈øe charges the Souldiers are in ≈øo lame and weak a <hi>po≈øture,</hi> that the <hi>Hor≈øe</hi> cannot choo≈øe if they come on with a full <hi>career,</hi> but beat the <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Pike-men</hi> down to the ground: Therefore in my opinion, the be≈øt way of oppo≈øing the <hi>Hor≈øe-charge,</hi> is that which we learned of our ever-honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Captain, Major Henry Tillier,</hi> in the <hi>Military Garden;</hi> which was, <hi>Files</hi> clo≈øing to the mid≈øt to their <hi>clo≈øe≈øt Order,</hi> in≈øomuch that there was not above half a foot <hi>interval</hi> of ground between <hi>File</hi> and <hi>File,</hi> the <hi>Pikes Porting,</hi> and after clo≈øing their <hi>Ranks</hi> forwards ≈øo clo≈øe, that they locked them≈øelves one within another, and then

charged on. Which in my judgment is ≈øo ≈øecure a way from <hi>routing,</hi> that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible for any Body of <hi>Hor≈øe</hi> to enter therein: and farther, to my be≈øt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, I never could meet with any Souldier that hath been a broad upon any ≈øervice, that ever ≈øaw any charging of the <hi>Pikes</hi> at the <hi>Foot;</hi> therefore I will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceed.</p>

ignorant of the honour of the re≈øt; neither know I the Dignity of a File eight or ten deep, which ≈øtill in ≈øome places they do retain, drawing them up ≈øo deep. If my ambition were but now fully ≈øatisfied herein, I ≈øhould in time come for to know the Dignity of the Captains, as they are drawn up all in a Regiment; by which Rule I am informed they walk. And in my judgment, there cannot be a truer ≈øtating the Dignity of a Rank and File, then that which ≈øhall conform to the Dignities of the Captains, as they are drawn up abre≈øt all in a Regiment. Now for as much as many Regiments con≈øi≈øt of ≈øeveral numbers of Captains, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies in them; as ≈øome ≈øix Companies, others eight; ≈øome greater, as ten, and twelve Companies: It is expedient therefore, not only for my ≈øelf, but for every ≈øouldier that will be truly knowing, to be re≈øolved herein concerning tho≈øe ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral numbers; and as occa≈øion ≈øhall alter to any other, they may inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves by the≈øe how to fit their purpo≈øe.

                     <p>THat which gives mo≈øt life for the true explaining of the former Table is, to ≈øhew the ≈øeveral places of Honour and Dignity of the Captains, how they are drawn up abre≈øt all in a Regiment. Be plea≈øed therefore to go along with me, and you ≈øhall under≈øtand that the <hi>Colonel</hi> hath the fir≈øt place of honour, as being Commander in chief, who≈øe Company ≈øtands upon the right, which makes the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure (1). The ≈øecond place of honour in the Regiment is the <hi>Lieutenant-Colonel,</hi> who≈øe Company is drawn up upon the left, as being the outmo≈øt there, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108706:7"/>
by the figure (2). The third place of honour is the <hi>Majors</hi> Company, which is drawn up upon the right of the left <hi>half Ranks,</hi> who≈øe place is de≈øcribed by the figure (3). The fourth place of honour is the elde≈øt <hi>Captains</hi> Company, which is drawn up upon the left of the right <hi>half Ranks,</hi> and is ≈øet forth by the figure (4). And now we have proceeded thus far, we will make <hi>Alt,</hi> and begin to examine whether we have rightly hitherto proceeded, or no; therefore, for the more cleering and under≈øtanding herein, you mu≈øt take notice, it is the di≈øcretion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very knowing Commander, ≈øo to aim and ≈øtate his Battail, as that he makes his Front equivalent in worth, ≈øtrength, and dignity to that of the Reer, and with equal proportion of number; and in like manner ≈øo to order his right <hi>half Ranks,</hi> as that they may carry an equal ballance in worth, number and dignity with the left <hi>half Ranks.</hi> Now therefore to begin to make ≈øome trial or experiment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by examining the fir≈øt worth with the fourth, and that will make the number (5) and then put to trial the ≈øecond worth and third, and you ≈øhall ea≈øily di≈øcern it to carry the ≈øame proportion of number. So that it may appear cleerly in the judgment of any di≈øcreet ≈øouldier a true and equal proportion, the Front with the Reer, the right <hi>half Ranks</hi> ≈øutable to the left <hi>half Ranks,</hi> and that both in number, honour, and dignity.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far entred into the di≈øcour≈øe, it remains to de≈øcribe and ≈øhew the rea≈øons of the other four of their places and dignity as they ≈øtand.</p>

                     <p>NOw for the further re≈øolution herein, there is to be taken notice of, That the general drawing up of Regiments, when they con≈øi≈øt of ≈øo few Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as 8, 6, or 7, is commonly in two grand Divi≈øions, that is to ≈øay, two bodies or two ≈øtands of <hi>Pikes</hi> which are flanked with <hi>Muskettiers.</hi> Therefore you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve, the di≈øcretion of the <hi>Major,</hi> who commonly is appointed to draw up the Regiments, doth ≈øo order the places of the <hi>Captains,</hi> that they may aptly fall into their due places of honour, upon a <hi>≈øtand</hi> and upon a <hi>march;</hi> and doth ≈øo order their dignities as before is expre≈øt, as to make both the Front, Reer, right and left <hi>half Ranks</hi> equal in number, ≈øtrength, and dignity. And therefore he draws up the third and fourth Captain between the <hi>Colonels</hi> Company and the elde≈øt <hi>Captain,</hi> which makes their number (13) and in like manner he draws the ≈øecond <hi>Captain</hi> and the younge≈øt <hi>Captain</hi> between the <hi>Lieutenant-Colonels</hi> Company and the <hi>Majors,</hi> who≈øe number likewi≈øe carries equal proportion to be (13). Now if you plea≈øe to examine the whole number of the right <hi>half Ranks,</hi> and that makes (18) make trial likewi≈øe of the left <hi>half Ranks,</hi> in ca≈øting up of his accompt, and you ≈øhall find the ≈øame proportion of number as is clearly ≈øet forth within the Table, both of <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files;</hi> for as the honour of every ≈øouldier ≈øtands in the <hi>Rank,</hi> you will find the ≈øame to ≈øtand ≈øo in the <hi>File.</hi>

                     <p>TO give you farther ≈øatisfaction, and Rea≈øons for the placing of the ≈øecond four, in re≈øpect it is contrary to the Rule and Judgment of ≈øome Souldiers, therefore farther ob≈øerve with me this, When a Regiment is drawn up in the true Order of a Regimental way, there, is as before expre≈ø≈øed, two bodies, or <hi>≈øtands</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> flanked with <hi>Muskettiers;</hi> and it is the Office of every <hi>Major</hi> to give forth in writing notes of paper unto every <hi>Captain,</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> where their place ≈øhall be upon a <hi>Stand,</hi> and where upon a <hi>March,</hi> that he may with more readine≈øs know where to lead, and where to fall in, or to bring up, as occa≈øion ≈øhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Now, for as much that it hath been the practice here in <hi>England,</hi> and in mo≈øt Countries al≈øo be≈øides, as I have been informed by very able knowing ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that the fir≈øt place of honour that is appointed out unto the Captains, is fir≈øt unto the elde≈øt, who alwayes leads the Colonels Colours, or fir≈øt grand Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which is the greate≈øt honour that can be appointed out unto the Captains, and therefore mo≈øt propere≈øt and due to him as being elde≈øt: If ≈øo, as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108706:8"/>
that it is then generally granted, that the leading of the Colonels Colours, or the fir≈øt <hi>body</hi> or <hi>≈øtand</hi> of <hi>Pikes</hi> in the Colonels grand Divi≈øion, is the fir≈øt and chiefe≈øt place of honour among≈øt the Captains; why then, certainly, I mu≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the ≈øecond Captain, which carries the number (5) would be infinitely wronged and injured, if he were denied, and not brought into the left <hi>half Ranks,</hi> for there he aptly ≈øtands to fall in, to lead the Lieutenant-Colonels Colours, or the ≈øecond <hi>body</hi> or <hi>≈øtand</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which is the ≈øecond place of honour. Now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving re≈øolved, that it is cleerly the due and right for the ≈øecond Captains place, to lead the ≈øecond body of <hi>Pikes;</hi> we mu≈øt then of nece≈ø≈øity bring in the younge≈øt Captain into the left <hi>half Ranks</hi> likewi≈øe, who carries the number (8) and that will make up an equal proportion, as before expre≈øt, to the third and fourth <hi>Captains,</hi> carrying with them the figures (6 and 7) which are drawn up in the right <hi>half rank.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Rea≈øons given for the la≈øt Table of every particular Place of Honour and Dignity, as they ≈øtand.</head>
                     <p>I Conceive what formerly hath been expre≈øt of the middle Table, may give full re≈øolution of the particular places of Honour and Dignity as they ≈øtand both in <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>File.</hi> It further now remains to ≈øpeak ≈øomewhat of the re≈øt, and therefore I ≈øhall go downward, cleering ≈øtill the fir≈øt four places of honour; which being rightly under≈øtood, the re≈øt will naturally fall into the capacity of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious ≈øouldier. Therefore further pray ob≈øerve with me this again in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ≈øutablene≈øs and equal proportion of worth and number of the fir≈øt and fourth worth, carrying unto that of the ≈øecond and third. And thus far you may re≈øt, and ≈øatisfie your ≈øelf therein. We have therefore now no more to place and ≈øettle, but the fifth and ≈øixth worth, and then our work in this Table will be quickly fini≈øhed. Therefore of nece≈ø≈øity, as formerly expre≈ø≈øed, we mu≈øt bring in the fifth worth into the left <hi>half Ranks,</hi> as being the ≈øecond Captain, who≈øe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, as I ≈øaid before, is to lead the Lieutenant-Colonels Colours, or the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>body</hi> or <hi>≈øtand</hi> of <hi>Pikes.</hi> He being there thus fixed, we have no more to place but the ≈øixth worth, which is the la≈øt, or younge≈øt Captain; and we have no other place to bring him in, but between the fir≈øt and fourth worth; or if you will have it more cleer, between the <hi>Colonel</hi> and elde≈øt <hi>Captain.</hi> But, here by the way, I am like to meet with ≈øome Objector that will ≈øay, Sir, What's become of your equal proportion here? Your right <hi>half Ranks,</hi> with your left, as you have ≈øo formerly ≈øtated them; your right <hi>half Ranks</hi> carrieth or exceedeth one more in number then your left <hi>half Ranks</hi> doth; and where we find the greater number, we mu≈øt conclude the le≈ø≈øer dignity; and if ≈øo, Why do you not rather contrive it on the left, then upon the right? To which I an≈øwer, fir≈øt, That in rai≈øing up of Companies into a Regiment, tho≈øe that are the <hi>Field</hi>-Officers by right ≈øhould have the mo≈øt men, and greater Companies, then the private Captains have: therefore if you will ob≈øerve in the ≈øtating of this Dignity of a Rank ≈øix abre≈øt, you will find in the left half Rank two <hi>Field</hi>-Officers, who≈øe Companies are the greater then any <hi>private</hi> Captains; certainly, they mu≈øt needs countervail with any number of men with the right half Ranks; for although the <hi>Colonels</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is, or ought ever to be the greate≈øt, yet there is no more <hi>Field</hi>-Officers, but him≈øelf in his Divi≈øion. And again, ≈øecondly, where there cannot be an equal dividing of number (as here you will find it of ≈øix abre≈øt, or ≈øix deep) but that there will fall out ≈øome odd, either on the right half Ranks, or on the left; and likewi≈øe the ≈øame either in the Front half files, or Reer half files, as by example in the trial you will ea≈øily find, by ca≈øting up the whole number as they ≈øtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre≈øt, and they will fall out to be (21) divide this number into two parts, and you cannot but mu≈øt ca≈øt the odd either on the right or on the left: Therefore to conclude, ≈øince that there is a great po≈ø≈øibility that there will be an equality of number of men in the left half Ranks ≈øutable to that of the right, where there ≈øhall fall out an odd number, that you cannot ca≈øt it into the left half Ranks, but that you mu≈øt remove the fifth worth; in this extremity I ≈øay you may not do it,

Yet I mu≈øt confe≈øs no <hi>Commander</hi> is ≈øo tied up or limited in the <hi>exerci≈øing</hi> of his men at all times to begin with <hi>Distances</hi> fir≈øt, ≈øo as to ≈øhew them all through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; but neverthele≈øs, in all and every one of the <hi>motions</hi> in the exerci≈øing of a <hi>Body,</hi> care mu≈øt be taken that the ≈øouldier have his proper <hi>di≈øtance</hi> for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ≈øame. Neither can any <hi>Leader</hi> exerci≈øe his men, but fir≈øt he mu≈øt command them to ≈øome <hi>di≈øtance</hi> ≈øutable to what he will begin. As ≈øome I have ≈øeen begin their <hi>exerci≈øes</hi> with <hi>Facings,</hi> ≈øome other with <hi>Doublings,</hi> others with <hi>Counter-marches</hi> and with <hi>Wheelings.</hi> Yet neverthele≈øs, whoever they be that will ≈øo begin, as I ≈øaid before, mu≈øt command his ≈øouldiers to ≈øome <hi>Di≈øtance,</hi> which may be proper for the ≈øame. But for my own part, my purpo≈øe is to go through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all parts of the <hi>Military exerci≈øe</hi> of Foot, and therefore will go on in order as they lie; and fir≈øt, as mo≈øt propere≈øt, I ≈øhall begin with <hi>Di≈øtances,</hi> to ≈øhew them all throughout, and what the nature of them be.</p>

                        <hi>Di≈øtance</hi> therefore really con≈øidered in it ≈øelf, is no <hi>Motion;</hi> but there are ≈øeveral <hi>motions</hi> to the attaining of each particular <hi>Di≈øtance,</hi> both in length and depth.

                     <p>The <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files</hi> being thus opened unto their <hi>twice double Di≈øtance</hi> from their <hi>clo≈øest Order,</hi> I conceive it to be a more ≈øouldierly-like way in the <hi>Opening</hi> and <hi>Clo≈øing</hi> of <hi>Files,</hi> that the di≈øcretion of the <hi>Commander</hi> do vary, and alter the hand in the commanding of them, then alwayes from every <hi>Di≈øtance</hi> to tie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to any particular hand; as to <hi>open to the right,</hi> and <hi>clo≈øe to the right.</hi> But as concerning the opening of <hi>Ranks,</hi> the propere≈øt way in my judgment is to open them alwayes to the <hi>Reer,</hi> in re≈øpect it is performed with more facility: For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Rank</hi> from the fir≈øt takes his due <hi>Di≈øtance</hi> as he is commanded, without any further trouble, or to a half-facing to the <hi>right,</hi> by taking it from the <hi>Reer,</hi> if from that place they ≈øhall be opened; and ≈øo likewi≈øe it were a great deal better in the <hi>clo≈øing of Ranks,</hi> to clo≈øe them forwards, in re≈øpect it is for the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of their clo≈øing, then to the <hi>Reer.</hi> For then, again, they mu≈øt perform a half-<hi>facing,</hi> which is not only unhand≈øome, but trouble≈øome to the ≈øouldier. All that can be ≈øaid to maintain it, (as I conceive, in opening <hi>Ranks</hi> forwards) is becau≈øe they have not room in the <hi>Reer;</hi> which ≈øeldome happens ≈øo in any <hi>exerci≈øe,</hi> if di≈øcreetly <hi>ordered</hi> by him that leads them. As for <hi>clo≈øing of the Ranks backwards,</hi> I cannot conceive any ≈øolid rea≈øons to confirm the ≈øame, and therefore will pa≈øs over it, and come to clo≈øe our <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files</hi> to ≈øuch <hi>Di≈øtance,</hi> from whence they fir≈øt were opened.</p>

them≈øelves ≈øo firm and ≈øtedfa≈øt, one within another, which 'twere impo≈ø≈øible for any <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Hor≈øe</hi> to enter in among≈øt them. Secondly, it is of excellent u≈øe for to maintain a <hi>breach,</hi> and to keep out an enemy. Thirdly, it is very u≈øeful to both Arms, at ≈øuch time when a Commander hath any thing of con≈øequence to di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto his Company, which he may have many occa≈øions ≈øo to do; as before his Exerci≈øe, to advi≈øe them to ≈øilence, to ob≈øerve their words of command, and their directions; and when they are to fight again≈øt an Enemy, to per≈øwade and keep them off from fear, by a≈ø≈øuring them good rea≈øons of hopes of overcoming. The≈øe, or ≈øuch-like ≈øpeeches, many times a <hi>Captain</hi> may have ju≈øt occa≈øion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs him≈øelf unto his Company; and being at ≈øo clo≈øe a <hi>Di≈øtance,</hi> they may more aptly hear his words, and obey his Commands. But here now by the way, too much preaching upon the head of a Company concerning matters of Exerci≈øe, is too much a dulling of the ≈øouldier, who rather would fall into action, then ≈øo to be confounded with much talking.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clo≈øe Order</hi> may be of very good u≈øe al≈øo for mo≈øt things which have been ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the <hi>clo≈øe≈øt Order;</hi> only here the ≈øouldier hath a little more liberty in the handling of his arms by being at a wider <hi>di≈øtance.</hi> This <hi>di≈øtance</hi> al≈øo is of good u≈øe, before <hi>wheelings,</hi> becau≈øe many times upon their moving, they are apt to flie out to their proper <hi>di≈øtance</hi> of <hi>Order,</hi> which they alwayes ≈øhould be at in their <hi>wheelings;</hi> where note, if fir≈øt they were at <hi>Order,</hi> they would flie out to wider <hi>di≈øtance.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Order</hi> is the <hi>di≈øtance</hi> which the ≈øouldier doth fight upon, and is to be u≈øed skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øhing again≈øt an enemy; it is al≈øo u≈øeful at ≈øuch a time, when the <hi>Drum</hi> ≈øhall beat a <hi>Troop,</hi> and that the ≈øouldiers are marching to relieve ≈øome <hi>Court of Guard,</hi> or making ≈øome expedition again≈øt an enemy, for then they are in a fit capacity of <hi>di≈øtance</hi> for to fight.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Open Order</hi> is the <hi>di≈øtance</hi> proper for all <hi>doublings</hi> of <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files,</hi> by the <hi>half-files</hi> or by the <hi>bringers-up,</hi> wherein they have <hi>interval</hi> of ground ≈øufficient to move in.

                     <p>The u≈øe of <hi>double Di≈øtance</hi> is to be ob≈øerved at ≈øuch times when the ≈øouldiers ≈øhall ≈øtand, or happen to be in ≈øome eminent danger of the <hi>Cannon-≈øhot</hi> from the Enemy; for ≈øtanding then ≈øo <hi>thin,</hi> they may be much pre≈øerved from danger: it is likewi≈øe very good for <hi>Inver≈øion,</hi> and <hi>Conver≈øion.</hi>

of every Officer under his Command, punctually at that hour and place, thither to repair, for the more incouraging of the ≈øouldiers as they ≈øhall come in, and not to ≈øtir them≈øelves from thence, without ≈øome order from their <hi>Captain,</hi> for fear of giving bad examples unto others. And when they ≈øhall perceive ≈øome con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of men to come in, the <hi>Serjeants</hi> then may take advice with their <hi>Lieutenant</hi> and <hi>En≈øign,</hi> which of them they will appoint out to draw forth the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and which the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and whom they ≈øhall make the right-hand <hi>File-leader</hi> of the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and who ≈øhall be the left; and again, who ≈øhall be the <hi>leader</hi> of the right-hand <hi>File</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> and who ≈øhall be the left: For the≈øe four, being ≈øuch remarkable places of Honour unto the knowing ≈øouldier, that ≈øpecial care mu≈øt be had in placing de≈øerving men to be there. Now it is, or ought to be the di≈øcretion of every <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> and <hi>En≈øign,</hi> (as being <hi>Commi≈ø≈øion-Officers</hi>) to re≈øolve the <hi>Serjeants</hi> herein, that they may with more alacrity go on to draw the re≈øt up between; and ≈øo to order unto each of them their particular duties, as to carry equal pains in drawing forth the <hi>Files.</hi> Therefore in re≈øpect that for the mo≈øt part in every Company, they have three <hi>Serjeants,</hi> two of them ought to take charge in drawing forth the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> (being helpt by the advice of their <hi>Lieutenant,</hi>) and the other to draw forth the <hi>Files</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> being a≈ø≈øi≈øted in coun≈øel by their <hi>En≈øign:</hi> for at ≈øuch times the <hi>Officers</hi> ought not to be idle, and to ≈øtand gazing upon each other; but every one, according to his particular place and relation, ≈øhould be very active and a≈ø≈øi≈øting to each other. In the drawing up the Company, the propere≈øt way will be then, as you may under≈øtand, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting up a Company, to draw them forth into <hi>Files,</hi> and to make them fix deep; as being our cu≈øtome here in <hi>England:</hi> and farther to have care in choo≈øing able ≈øouldiers to be <hi>File-leaders,</hi> who having ≈øpent ≈øome time and pains in their <hi>Files</hi> in ≈øhewing them their <hi>Po≈øtures,</hi> they may be called to joyn into a <hi>body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For farther direction herein unto the <hi>Serjeants</hi> (who≈øe proper place it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto) to ob≈øerve this order in drawing up their <hi>Files,</hi> that they may ingro≈ø≈øe the <hi>Pikes</hi> into one <hi>body</hi> by them≈øelves, and the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> into another, and not to flank the <hi>Pikes</hi> until ≈øuch time they ≈øhall perceive that in both Arms they are compleat: There are likewi≈øe ≈øeveral places of honour that the <hi>Serjeants</hi> ought to take notice of, and to be informed of placing of men of worth and de≈øert in both Arms, that is to ≈øay, in the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> and of the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath by figures I ≈øhall ≈øet forth for farther ≈øatisfaction therein.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <figDesc>formation</figDesc>
                     </figure>
                     <p>Here I have ≈øet down the manner how the Serjeants ≈øhould draw up their Files in each Arms apart by them≈øelves, and have figured forth unto them the four chief places of honour in both Arms. It concerns them therefore very much to mind and have regard to the≈øe particular places, and to order ≈øuch men of worth there, which may be well de≈øerving of the ≈øame; and tho≈øe Gentlemen whom they ≈øhall think fit after to be worthy of File-leaders places, they are to draw them up between the figure (1) and the figure (4), and between the figure (3) and the figure (2) and that Rule to ob≈øerve in both Arms; and to be careful to place good ≈øouldiers in the Reer, and ≈øuch who may be able ≈øouldiers for half-File-leaders, becau≈øe there may be much occa≈øion by Doublings to bring them up for to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Front.</p>
                     <p>Thus much, I do confe≈øs, may be ≈øufficient for the pre≈øent to give directions to the <hi>Serjeants</hi> for the drawing up the Files, and joyning them together. Next, after I have ≈øhewn how to flank their <hi>Pikes</hi> with <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> I will ≈øet forth unto

                     <p>Next followeth to flank the <hi>≈øtand</hi> of <hi>Pikes</hi> with the <hi>Muskettiers;</hi> command the Gentlemen of the <hi>Pikes</hi> to face to the right, and left <hi>half-Ranks</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to Face to the left, and then to march and interchange ground, <hi>facing</hi> after to their leaders, and clo≈øing <hi>Files</hi> inward to order, they will ≈øtand as underneath is ≈øet forth.</p>

And in like manner he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108706:11"/>
the third Serjeant to the left Angle in the Reer; as being the ≈øecond younge≈øt, and may be a help unto his Lieutenant there, as the fourth is to him in the Front. The elde≈øt Serjeant he orders to the left Angle in the Front, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mo≈øt honourable place for him, being there ready to lead upon a march the Van of the Reer-Guard; and the ≈øecond Serjeant he is appointed to ≈øtand on the right Angle of the Reer, to make them equal in dignity unto the Front. Now if you plea≈øe to examine the dignity of the Serjeants in the fir≈øt place, as the fir≈øt Serjeant and the fourth, making the number (5) and after take a view of the ≈øecond place, or Reer, and there you ≈øhall ob≈øerve that the ≈øecond Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and third, may every way ballance them≈øelves, to be equivalent in the worth with the fir≈øt and fourth, carrying with them alike the ≈øame number. So that it is clearly evident, that the Serjeants are rightly ≈øtated in number and dignity, the Front proportionably with the Reer, in the judgement of any knowing Souldier. Something more may be ≈øpoken of the ≈øecond Serjeants place, which you may take notice in his march, to lead the ≈øecond Divi≈øion of Pikes, which is the mo≈øt honourable≈øt place of leading that is appointed forth unto the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, the fir≈øt only excepted; and upon a ≈øtand, when they ≈øhall lead up their Divi≈øions, every Serjeant is to betake him unto his place, as they were at fir≈øt placed, and to continue there until ≈øuch time they ≈øhall receive further order from their Captain. Thus much, I conceive, may give ≈øatisfaction unto the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Souldier in the≈øe particulars, leaving them liberty to judge according unto their own be≈øt thoughts, while we endeavour to draw up our Divi≈øions all abre≈øt again, and to make ≈øome de≈øcription of a Body.</p>
                     <p>The Captain upon his March having attained ≈øome convenient place to draw up his Company, makes Alt, and commands the Serjeants to lead up their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions upon the left, and cau≈øes the Muskettiers to open from the Pikes, making ≈øufficient intervals for the Drums, to beat two abre≈øt, even with the Front, the fir≈øt two between the right-hand-File-leader of Pikes, and the Muskettiers upon the right; the ≈øecond two Drums doing the like upon the left. And always the Captain ought to march his company after this manner all abre≈øt, provided he have ground ≈øufficient for the ≈øame. And being far more graceful ≈øo to do, then to march them ≈øtragling upon a long march, for it doth repre≈øent in ≈øome kind the manner of marching of a Regiment; and at ≈øuch times the Serjeants are to march upon the Angles, as is before de≈øcribed, moving to and again ≈øometimes upon the Flanks, and cau≈øing the Souldiers to keep their Di≈øtance of order in File, and open order in Rank, and to march all even abre≈øt, and after to return again unto their places.</p>

                     <p>But when they are drawn up, and ≈øo march even abre≈øt, the younge≈øt Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants place, as is before expre≈øt, is to march upon the right Angle in the Front, and the elde≈øt upon the left, the ≈øecond Serjeant is to march in the right Angle in the Reer. They having their places thus ≈øtated, are to move ≈øometimes up and down upon the Flanks in their marching, cau≈øing the Souldiers to keep their due di≈øtance of order in File, and open order in Rank, and to march even abre≈øt, and after they may return to their places again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:108706:12"/>But here, methinks, I meet with ≈øome Objector by the way, who ≈øaith, the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt is much wronged herein; for that it is his proper place to be upon the right; that when Forlorns are drawn off again≈øt an Enemy, he is there ready fir≈øt to lead them on, claiming it as his due to give the fir≈øt on ≈øet, and therefore far more honour for him to be on the right then on the left, and the elde≈øt Serjeant ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther placed on the left then on the right. As for the ≈øecond Serjeants place, 'tis fit he ≈øhould be in the Reer, to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Lieutenant there, he having none but he to help him, if any occa≈øion ≈øhould require. To which I an≈øwer, that it is the younge≈øt Serjeants place to be upon the right Angle, either upon a Stand, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a March, and not the elde≈øt, for the≈øe rea≈øons following. The younge≈øt Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant is not placed there for any honour that it is to him, for he hath no Divi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all to lead upon the March (except the Company be very great) and if ≈øo, he is placed ≈øo near the Captain, to be ≈øerviceable to him, to carry and convey his plea≈øures unto all the re≈øt of the Officers. As for the leading of the Van-guard upon the March, the Captain takes that place unto him≈øelf; and it is far more honour unto the elde≈øt Serjeant to be a Leader of the Reer-guard, or entirely the left Flank, then to lead a Subdivi≈øion of Pikes. And be≈øides that, it is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt for his place to be upon the left, when they are all drawn up upon a bre≈øt, for the≈øe two rea≈øons; as fir≈øt, he is thereupon in readine≈øs to take his due place, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ≈øub-dividing on the long March; and again, upon a Stand, when they are all drawn up, and ready to engage again≈øt an Enemy, and the Forlorns to be drawn forth, equally alike from both Flanks, he is then as ready in the Front to execute his Captains Commands, the younge≈øt Serjeant being likewi≈øe ≈øent to be ≈øomething helpful to him, and attending after for further order from his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to ≈øend him relief by the ≈øecond Serjeant, as occa≈øion ≈øhall require. So that in my judgement, take it either upon the long March, or otherwi≈øe, when drawn all up even abre≈øt, all things are ≈øo ≈øtated, for his due honour and place, that he hath no rea≈øon to complain, nor any of the re≈øt, having all their due and proper places which doth belong unto them.</p>
                     <p>As for the placing of the Drums upon the long March, every Divi≈øion ought to have his Drums fall between ≈øuch Ranks as before expre≈øt; excepting only the ≈øecond Divi≈øion of Pikes, which may be excu≈øed, when they are to beat a March, as being all drawn up, they are to fall in two, to beat even abre≈øt upon the right, and one upon the left, as is before ≈øet down. If it ≈øhould chance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Company, to be ≈øo ≈ømall to have but three Divi≈øions, that is to ≈øay, one Divi≈øion of Muskettiers in the Van, the Body of Pikes in the mid≈øt, and another Divi≈øion of Muskettiers to bring up the Reer-guard, and having but two Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and two Drums; the younge≈øt Serjeants place will be as before mentioned, upon the right in the Front, and the elde≈øt Serjeant upon the left, and to take his place to lead the la≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers upon the long March; and the fir≈øt Drum to beat in the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, and the ≈øecond to beat and to march along among≈øt the Pikes. I have a little more enlarged my ≈øelf in this Di≈øcour≈øe of placing of the Serjeants, then I at fir≈øt intended; but meeting many times with ≈øeveral Souldiers, de≈øiring ≈øatisfaction in every one of the≈øe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I ≈øhall perhaps undergo here the hard cen≈øure of ≈øome, for this my tedious Di≈øcour≈øe; but ≈øuch others which de≈øire to be knowing herein, I hope they will have a more favourable opinion of my good meaning unto them. And here I ≈øhall conclude for the pre≈øent, concerning the particular places of the Serjeants in every private Company; and now ≈øuppo≈øing, as by order from the Captain, the Serjeants have brought up their Divi≈øions, ≈øtanding again, as before, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ≈øomething more to be ≈øpoken unto them, they ≈øilently ≈øtand to hear what follows.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> A De≈øcription of a Body of men throughout, with all their ≈øeveral parts and kinds.</head>
                     <p>IT is very nece≈ø≈øary knowledge to every particular Souldier, to be acquainted throughout with all the parts of a Body of men drawn up, with their ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral extents and bounds, and with the true under≈øtanding of the ≈øame.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108706:12"/>
Where fir≈øt note the De≈øcription of Files; a File is a Sequence of men, con≈øi≈øting of Leaders and Followers, from the fir≈øt unto the la≈øt; the joyning of Files flank-wi≈øe maketh Ranks, and is the compleating up of a Body: for one File alone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ≈øaid to have any Ranks in it, but joyning two or more Files together unto one, you may account them (provided they be ≈øix deep) to have ≈øo many Ranks for number, as doth extend from their Leaders to their Bringers-up. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know, that a Rank is a Row of men, ≈øtanding ≈øhoulder to ≈øhoulder, in an even line from the left Flank to the right; or from the outmo≈øt man upon the left, unto the outmo≈øt man upon the right; ≈øtanding all in a row File-wi≈øe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be ≈øaid of one Rank, to have any Files in it; for as the clo≈øing of Files to Files, makes Ranks; ≈øo the adding of Ranks to Ranks, makes Files.</p>
                     <p>As for the Depth of Files, they have in the≈øe latter Ages much varied therein; ≈øometimes making them ≈øixteen deep, others ten, and eight deep, and now late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they have brought them unto ≈øix deep, as being the cu≈øtom of the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> and altogether now the practice here in <hi>England.</hi> In which form and way, I purpo≈øe to walk. But to proceed to my former promi≈øe to the Souldier: There is in every Body of men drawn up, con≈øi≈øting of Pikes and Muskettiers, whether of greater or ≈ømaller number, it makes no matter; <hi>A Front,</hi> a <hi>Reer,</hi> a <hi>Right-flank,</hi> and a <hi>Left-flank;</hi> there is al≈øo <hi>Front-half-files,</hi> and <hi>Reer-half-files;</hi> there is a <hi>Right-half-ranks,</hi> and a <hi>Left-half-ranks;</hi> and there is a <hi>Length</hi> and <hi>Depth</hi> of the Battail: and of every one of the≈øe in their ≈øeveral kinds. They have their particular extents and bounds, according to their number of men.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, take notice in the fir≈øt place, that the Front is the fir≈øt Rank, or Row of men, which are the File-leaders, and chief men of their Files, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ought to take charge of their Files, being as it were their Captains, and leads them fir≈øt on in the Brunt again≈øt a furious Enemy. The extent of the Front is from the left-hand File-leader, unto the Leader of the right-hand File.</p>
                     <p>The Reer is the la≈øt Row or Rank of men, being the Bringers-up of the Files, who next the Leaders are the chiefe≈øt men of honour in the File, and are as it were unto them, their Lieutenants; and in the ab≈øence of their Leaders, they are to take charge of the File, and to in≈øtruct them in their po≈øtures: the extent of the Reer, is from the Bringer-up of the left-hand File, unto the place of the Bringer-up of the right.</p>
                     <p>The right Flank is the outmo≈øt File upon the right, where always ought, by the way, to be very able Souldiers placed, becau≈øe they fir≈øt give on≈øet, or fire again≈øt the Enemy, if on that part they ≈øhall be charged; the extent of the right Flank is from the Leader of the right-hand File, unto the Bringer-up of the ≈øame.</p>
                     <p>The left Flank likewi≈øe is the outmo≈øt File upon the left, and his extent is from the Leader of the left-hand File, unto the Bringer-up.</p>
                     <p>The Front half-Files extent or bounds, reacheth no farther then from the Front, unto the mid≈øt of Ranks, or to the Bringers-up of the Front half-files, which being but ≈øix deep, is the third Rank from the Front; and the length of the ≈øame reacheth from the outmo≈øt part of the left Flank, until you come unto the right.</p>
                     <p>The Reer half-Files beginneth from the mid≈øt of Ranks, or from the fourth Rank from the Front, and runneth downward in his depth to the Bringer-up of the whole File; and the Length of the ≈øame is to be taken ≈øide-wi≈øe, as they ≈øtand ≈øhoulder to ≈øhoulder, from the outmo≈øt man upon the left, unto the outmo≈øt man upon the right.</p>
                     <p>The right half-Ranks in their Length runneth no farther, then from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt man upon the right, unto the mid≈øt of Files, or to the left-hand File-leader of the right half-Ranks; the Depth of the right half-Ranks reacheth from the Front, running down unto the Reer.</p>
                     <p>As for the left half-Ranks, as much may be ≈øaid, to take his Length from the mid≈øt of Files, or from the right-hand File-leader, of the left half-Ranks unto the outmo≈øt Files upon the left; the Depth of the left half-Ranks, may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood in form and manner conformable to the right.</p>
                     <p>Next come we to ≈øpeak of the Length and Depth of the whole Battail: the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108706:13"/>
Length of the Battail is ever to be accounted of the number of men in a Rank, and not in a File; for the Files perhaps may not be above ≈øix deep, when that there may be hundreds in a Bre≈øt in the Ranks: and farther, the Length of any Battail is to be taken from the outmo≈øt point of the left Flank, or left-hand File-leader, ≈øtretching it ≈øelf forth by an even Line along, until you come to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt point of right Flank, or right-hand File-leader; the Depth of the Battail always is to be taken from the Front or fir≈øt Rank, and going down backward in a ≈øtraight Line down to the Reer, to the la≈øt Rank, or to the Bringers-up of the Files. For as the Length of the Battail is to be taken from the left Flank, going along in Front unto the right; ≈øo the Depth of the Battail is to be taken from the Front, going backward down to the Reer.</p>
                     <p>There is al≈øo to be under≈øtood, that in every <hi>Battalia</hi> drawn up, there are other parts and Denominations, very con≈øiderable to be known, that is, in every ≈øuch an one, there is a Van-Guard, a Reer-Ward, and Main-Battail. The Van-Guard are the Muskettiers upon the right, or the right Flank; or as mo≈øt commonly called among≈øt us in the≈øe days, the Right-wing, or the Left-wing, which are the Muskettiers, and the Flankers of the Body of Pikes; the rea≈øon, as I conceive, the Muskettiers are accounted and called Wings, is becau≈øe they are fir≈øt drawn off, as by flying motions in Forlorns, to engage again≈øt an Enemy; but of this by the way. To proceed: the Reer-Ward or Reer-Guard, are the Muskettiers on the left Flank; and the Battail is the Body of Pikes; and here I ≈øhall conclude concerning the de≈øcription of a Body.</p>

                     <p>HE that intends to exerci≈øe a Body of men, mu≈øt truly know what he ≈øhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ≈øo to give his directions unto the Souldiers, as they may aptly make ready execution of the ≈øame. He mu≈øt at ≈øuch times above all the re≈øt, a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume unto him≈øelf the confidence and pre≈øence (as near as he is able) of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Souldier. He is al≈øo to ≈øtretch out his voice ≈øo, as he may conveniently be heard, and under≈øtood by the inferior Officers and Souldiers; which will cau≈øe them more readily to obey his commands. He ought to carry a chearful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unto them, provided they do well; but otherwi≈øe, if carele≈øly di≈øregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Commands, he may look har≈øhly upon them. His eyes ought to be quick and nimble, ob≈øerving all their motions, whether it be to the right or left, to the Front or Reer, and nimbly ≈øtepping to them, to ≈øtay them, if di≈øorderly they ≈øwerve awry from what he fir≈øt intended. He mu≈øt likewi≈øe order all his words of Command ≈øo, as that they may be proper, and clearly pronounced forth unto the Souldier, without any faltering. And in every one of the≈øe, to ≈øee the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier lea≈øurely and ea≈øily perform the ≈øame in a compleat manner. He mu≈øt not be too quick in his words of Command, but carefully ≈øee what before commanded well done, and then he may proceed unto the next. In time of his Exerci≈øe, he mu≈øt ≈øeriou≈øly mind what he is to do, and not to have his thoughts extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried away upon any other Subject, for fear he be out; but if any ≈øuch thing ≈øhould happen through forgetfulne≈øs, he ought not to be daunted, but to pull up the ≈øpirit of a Souldier as well as he can, and endeavour to reduce them again. For it is a rare thing to be found, for a Leader to be ≈øo exqui≈øite in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øing, as not to be ≈øometimes out; and in my ob≈øervation of mo≈øt, at one time or another, I have found them ≈øo to be. His di≈øcretion al≈øo ought to be ≈øuch, as to cull out, and chu≈øe tho≈øe things that be chiefe≈øt, as flowers out of a Garden, to fit and compleat up his Exerci≈øe in a Souldier-like way; which may be mo≈øt propere≈øt for ≈øervice and u≈øe, which will bring to him far more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and prai≈øe in the judgement of every knowing Souldier, then to ≈øpend his time upon unnece≈ø≈øary toyes; but yet ≈øometimes, to plea≈øe the fancy of the curious, at their private meetings he may u≈øe ≈øome things for delight, to ≈øupport and uphold their private Exerci≈øes, which have nur≈øt up here in <hi>London</hi> many able Souldiers and Commanders, who have been ≈øerviceable to our Nation. It
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108706:13"/>
is a very nece≈ø≈øary thing likewi≈øe that a Leader ≈øometimes do acquaint the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the u≈øe of their ≈øeveral Di≈øtances, Facings, Doublings, Counter-marches, and Wheelings, and of all things el≈øe he ≈øhall command; but in ≈øuch a manner, that he dwell not too long upon any thing he ≈øhall declare unto them, for dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Souldiers, who rather would be plea≈øed with more actings, then by too much talkings; which ≈øpins out the time, as ≈øometimes ordered, to very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpo≈øe. He mu≈øt be very careful of every word of Command he gives, that the Souldiers be ordered in their due Di≈øtance, ≈øutable to the ≈øame, of what kind ≈øoever it be; and if it ≈øhall be lo≈øt in their movings or marchings, he mu≈øt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring them to it again. He is likewi≈øe to acquaint the Souldiers when they are drawn up, to look about them, and to mind their ≈øeveral places, how they ≈øtand in the Body, whether they be in even Ranks from the Front, or odd; if even, and upon any doubling of Ranks, they are the men to double the odd; if half-file-leaders, that they be commanded to double the Front; they mu≈øt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their Arms, and are Leaders of that Motion to come up to double the Front; if Bringers-up commanded to double, they are alike to do the ≈øame; if Bringers up of the Front-half-files, and that they be commanded to double the Reer, they likewi≈øe are to advance their Arms, to face about, and are to begin to lead them down to the Reer. They ≈øhould likewi≈øe take notice how they ≈øtand in their Files, whether even from the right, or no; if even, and there be any command to double Files to the right, they all are to move, and double the odd; if commanded to double to the left, they then ≈øtand odd; and the others are to move, and double them. They likewi≈øe are to mind their places, who are upon the Flanks, for a doubling either to Front or Reer by the half-Files; they fir≈øt begin to march, and how they ≈øtand there as right and left-hand men in even Ranks; for by any doublings of Ranks entire, or by Divi≈øion, they likewi≈øe are the Leaders of the Motion. There ought al≈øo advice be given to the middle File-leaders, to know their places; for if there ≈øhould be any doublings of the half-Ranks, they then are fir≈øt to move, and to begin the motion.</p>
                     <p>This caution being ≈øometimes quickly run over in advi≈øing of the Souldiers, that they ≈øhould ever mind when they are fir≈øt drawn up into a body the≈øe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places, they would not ≈øtand ≈øo carele≈ø≈øy and ≈øo ignorantly in a Body, as many times they do, not knowing which way to move without a great deal of pains and directions from their Leader; for there being ≈øo many occa≈øions of doublings of the≈øe kinds, that it is a nece≈ø≈øary thing for every Souldier to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ≈øame.</p>
                     <p>Yet it is not only ≈øufficient that the Souldiers do mind their places as they ≈øtand in a body, according to the direction of their <hi>Leader,</hi> as before ≈øet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but that they be likewi≈øe, in the time of their Exerci≈øe, very ≈øilent in the body, and helpful unto their fellow-Souldiers, by pointing out unto them with ≈øigns with the hand, where they ≈øhould march, to perform what was before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and to be very civil and orderly in their carriage to each other, and to mind their Exerci≈øe ≈øo as a matter of great weight, and high con≈øideration in the well regarding of the ≈øame. And if a word of command (as ≈øometimes may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen) ≈ølip out of order, as by the mi≈øtaking of a hand or the like, yet neverthele≈øs it ≈øhould be their mode≈øt care, if not prevented by their Leader, to be ready to execute what they conceive he intended; and walking along in this civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpective way unto him that ≈øhall lead them, it will not only be a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement unto him, but they will al≈øo reap much benefit unto them≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>And thus much briefly may be ≈øpoken in way of advice unto every Leader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his beginning of his Exerci≈øe, and unto each particular Souldier as ≈øhall by him be exerci≈øed.</p>

                     <p>FAcing is the altering or turning of the A≈øpect to either hand upon the ground they ≈øtand, according to the words of Command, whether it be to the right,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108706:14"/>
left, Front or Reer, or to the mid≈øt of Files or Ranks, or to any of the outward or inward Angles, or to the Center.</p>
                     <p>The manner of execution of the ≈øame, it is a particular turning of every Souldiers countenance unto each of tho≈øe hands or places as above expre≈øt, and to be performed after this manner. The left foot is always to be kept fixed like the hinge of a door, and unto what hand or part they ≈øhall be commanded to face, every particular Souldier is immediately to turn his body upon the Ball or Centre of his left foot by wheeling, until he hath brought his A≈øpect unto the place commanded.</p>
                     <p>Facings is one of the mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary and u≈øefulle≈øt motions among≈øt all the re≈øt: for when the body ≈øhall be in ≈øuch a ≈øtreight that they cannot bring their faces again≈øt an enemy by Counter-march, or by a Wheeling, to bring their be≈øt Souldiers there to fight; and likewi≈øe being debarred of room that they cannot double it, neverthele≈øs Facings are of ≈øuch excellent u≈øe, that they may with ea≈øe, although ≈øtanding at clo≈øe Order, turn every particular face to charge upon that part where they ≈øhall be a≈ø≈øaulted by an enemy: and farther, this motion is performed with more facility then all the re≈øt of the motions. For in the others they alter the form of the Battail, or changeth the place, but in this they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve both, and it is ready for any attempt of an enemy: if they ≈øhould be charged all at once in Front, Reer, right and left Flanks, they may be commanded ≈øo to face, as to an≈øwer them all in every one of their charges.</p>
                     <p>Facings likewi≈øe are ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary, that they can hardly be ≈øpared in any other of the motions, having relation in one kind or other to them all for to be u≈øed. There is likewi≈øe farther to be under≈øtood, that there are Entire-Facings and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øional. Entire Facings are when they turn their A≈øpects all one way: Divi≈øio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Facings are when they divert or turn their faces ≈øeveral ways, as to the Front, Reer, and both Flanks, all at one in≈øtant of time as ≈øhall be commanded.</p>
                     <p>There are likewi≈øe facings to the Front and Reer Angles, that is to ≈øay, of their outward and inward Angles. Outward Angles are when they are commanded to face to the right Angle or to the left, or both facing to the inward Angles, as when they are commanded ≈øo, as to face to the inward Angles towards the mid≈øt of Files. There is likewi≈øe facing to the inward Angles towards the mid≈øt of Ranks as to the Center; where note, when there is any u≈øe of the≈øe Facings unto the inward Angles, it is occa≈øioned by ≈øome former words of command, that hath made ≈øome large intervals in the mid≈øt of Ranks or Files, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may give them ≈øuch commands as the≈øe for to open or ≈øtand ≈øo, that they may march and clo≈øe again as at fir≈øt.</p>
                     <p>This Facing to the Center, I do conceive to be very u≈øeful, when the Captain or Leader hath any thing of importance to ≈øpeak unto the Company; they ≈øtanding at clo≈øe order, he may ≈øide-wi≈øe move down into the mid≈øt of the Ranks and Files, and command them to face all to the Center; they ≈øtanding all round about him ≈øo clo≈øe, cannot chu≈øe but hear and know what his plea≈øure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand will be, and in obedience thereunto, be very ready in performance for the execution of the ≈øame.</p>
                     <p>But before I come to ≈øet down the words of Command for Facings, I ≈øhall de≈øire all Leaders not to tye them≈øelves up ≈øo as not to begin in their Exerci≈øe to command Facings, until they have brought the Souldiers to ≈øtand at open order, both in Rank and File, as if it were not proper for them to command them to face till then. Therefore rather, for the rea≈øons before ≈øet forth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to chu≈øe upon ≈øuch clo≈øe Di≈øtances to face, that they may know the true u≈øe of them, and at ≈øuch times when they want ground that the other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot be performed.</p>

As you were, or, To your Leader.</p>
                     <p>Having concluded the words of Command for performing of plain Facings, there mu≈øt be notice taken, when any word of Command ≈øhall be given to face to any of the Reer-Angles, they mu≈øt be fir≈øt faced to the Reer, and they will make more ea≈øier performance of the ≈øame; and likewi≈øe, if any word of Command be given to face to the inward Angles upon the Flanks, they mu≈øt face them there likewi≈øe fir≈øt, and it will be ea≈øier fulfilled: and likewi≈øe if any command be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to face to the four Angles, or to Front, Reer, and Mid≈øt from the Center, care mu≈øt be fir≈øt had that they may be fir≈øt faced to the Center.</p>
                     <p>I might have proceeded a great deal farther in this place upon this Subject of <hi>Facings,</hi> to have ≈øhewn ≈øeveral figures of Battail that might be produced and drawn forth, affording much variety of forms and number, and with much ea≈øe to be performed upon their ≈øeveral marchings, according as they are ordered to face, which might be very u≈øeful for ≈øervice, and affording much matter for any particular Exerci≈øe, to u≈øe ≈øeveral firings upon the ≈øame. But I ≈øhall have occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in another place to make u≈øe of divers of them, and ≈øetting them forth in the view, when I ≈øhall begin to ≈øet down in any particular Leadings of my own, which I have performed in our private meetings at <hi>Town-Ditch</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> every Thur≈øday-morning, for the ≈øatisfaction of tho≈øe loving Gentlemen who ≈øtill do Exerci≈øe there, and to ≈øuch which ≈øhall come after.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIX,</hi> The many variety of <hi>Doublings,</hi> with their parts and u≈øes ≈øet forth for the practice of any Commander, to make u≈øe of according unto his own di≈øcretion.</head>
                     <p>SInce there is in the true account, no other dimen≈øion of a Battail, but the Length and Depth, ≈øo likewi≈øe it is to be under≈øtood, that the Length of the Battail is doubled by the doublings of Ranks and half-Files; and the Depth of the Battail is doubled by the doubling of Files, and of the half-Ranks. Now there are ≈øeveral Words of Command for the performance of each of the≈øe, as to double Ranks and Files, which do con≈øi≈øt either of the doubling of number of men and per≈øons, and not of place, or el≈øe the doubling both of number and place. As for Example, command either the Ranks, the half-files, or Bringers-up to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108706:15"/>
double the Front to the right; here only is the doubling of number of men, and not of place, for it adds but one man more to that hand, whereunto they were commanded, and gains but his particular place. Again, double Ranks to any hand entire or double, the Front by the half-Files to the right entire, it will be not only a doubling of the number of men, but a doubling of the place, and the Length of the Battail. The u≈øe of doubling the Length of the Battail may be for two Rea≈øons, the one to over-wing an Enemy, the other to avoid over-winging our ≈øelves. Yet there mu≈øt be care taken, that in doubling of the Length, that we fail not, or be too weak in our Depth: for the want of both, either Length or Depth, may be very dangerous to our ≈øelves, and may give great advantage to the Enemy. For if there ≈øhould want a ≈øufficient Depth, by gaining much Length in the Front, we may perhaps be ≈øo weak there, that an Enemy may quickly break through, whereby much danger may en≈øue upon the ≈øame, if not timely prevented by the di≈øcretion of the Commanders.</p>
                     <p>There is likewi≈øe in the doubling of Files, or the half-Ranks doubling to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flank, a doubling of number of men, and not of place, carrying much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of words of Command; but the doubling of Files, and of the left half-Ranks entire, the Depth of the right Flank is not only a doubling of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but a doubling of the place and Depth of the Battail. In this doubling of the Depth care likewi≈øe mu≈øt be had, that we make not the Front too narrow, le≈øt we give opportunity to the Enemy to encircle, and encompa≈øs it. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, take notice that Doublings were invented to ≈øtrengthen any part of the Body that ≈øhall be weak, whether in the Front, or Reer-right-flank, or left, whether it be in number of men or place, Length or Depth, it is to be u≈øed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the di≈øcretion of the Commander. There is likewi≈øe farther to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered in Doublings, whether they double the number or place, Length or Depth, it is to be performed by one of the≈øe two, either entire, or divi≈øional Doublings: therefore I ≈øhall proceed, and go on to ≈øhew what I conceive to be the propere≈øt way in the progre≈øs of them in a right order; and therefore I will begin to ≈øet down the words of Command; Fir≈øt, to double the Front, and ≈øo far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceed to ≈øhew the Doublings of the Flanks. And fir≈øt of entire Doublings, and next of the divi≈øional; and in the mean time, I ≈øhall crave pardon from the courteous Souldier, that I put not down ≈øeveral Pricks or Figures to ≈øet forth the ≈øame, endeavouring rather to give him the words of Command for each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doubling, with directions for performance of the ≈øame, together with their ≈øeveral Reducements, leaving it to his ingenious ≈øtudy and practice, to make u≈øe of what he plea≈øeth, where he may cull and chu≈øe out ≈øuch as ≈øhall be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and fit, either for ≈øervice or delight; by the way advi≈øing him to retain in his memory, what he intends to practi≈øe, and not to meddle with any thing, but what he a≈ø≈øuredly knows will carry ≈øuch weight and able rea≈øons for their u≈øe and ≈øervice, as ≈øhall admit of no controlment from the judicious Souldier.</p>

                     <p>Here endeth all the plain Doublings to the right Flank, performed by ≈øeveral Counter-marches and Wheelings, which to any ingenious Souldier are ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent directions to know how to double the left Flank, only altering the hand by the words of Command.</p>
                     <p>And here fellow-Souldier endeth all the ≈øeveral kinds of Doublings, which if any ≈øhall ≈øeem hard or difficult unto thee, either in their Commands, Directions, or Reducements, thou may≈øt (care being taken) with much ea≈øe and delight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ≈øame. And here the Captain is to take ≈øpecial notice, when he comes to the point of Doublings, that his propere≈øt way will be fir≈øt to double the Front, as being the mo≈øt honourable part of the Body, and next the Reer, and after either to the right or left Flank, leaving it to his di≈øcretion to u≈øe as many of them as he ≈øhall think fitting, and convenient for his Exerci≈øe. And although I have ≈øomewhat varied from the practi≈øe of former times in u≈øing more plenty of words of Command, the ripene≈øs and curio≈øity of Wits in the≈øe our days, enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me unto it; for they having much refined the <hi>Military Di≈øcipline,</hi> will not be plea≈øed with ordinary ≈øtuff (as to ≈øay, <hi>As you were</hi>) which, I confe≈øs, would ≈øave the Captain a great deal of pains, and be more ea≈øie to the apprehen≈øion and capacity of every private Souldier, for his returning back unto his place again. Yet if Command ≈øhould be given to double any part of the Body, that Leader would quickly lie under a hard cen≈øure, and be judged in mo≈øt mens opinions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øufficient, that could not find out ≈øome other words of Command to reduce them again. Endeavouring therefore to give full ≈øatisfaction to both parties, I have taken the pains to ≈øet down other words of Command for <hi>Reducement,</hi> whereby tho≈øe which ≈øhall profe≈øs them≈øelves curious, may cull out ≈øuch plenty as may be≈øt plea≈øe their <hi>genius;</hi> advi≈øing them withal not to pre≈øume in the exerci≈øing of their private Companies, before them≈øelves be fir≈øt well ver≈øt, and truly knowing in all and every of the ≈øeveral Commands, Directions, and Reducements before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; which being obtained, they may confidently and boldly proceed, ≈øo to inure their Souldiers in the practi≈øe thereof, that their own knowledge in a ≈øhort time will reduce them to their former places without u≈øing the≈øe thred-bare words, <hi>As you were;</hi> variety being more profitable and delightful unto them, (provided they under≈øtand it) then to accu≈øtom them in an ordinary and plain way of reducing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:108706:19"/>But here ≈øome men will be ready to carp and ≈øay, that I have troubled my ≈øelf to little purpo≈øe, in ≈øetting down more <hi>Doublings</hi> then are u≈øed abroad upon ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. To whom I an≈øwer, that there are none (if rightly under≈øtood) but are of ≈øingular u≈øe one time or another, either in private <hi>Meetings,</hi> or in tho≈øe great <hi>Nur≈øeries</hi> of <hi>Military Di≈øcipline,</hi> the famous <hi>Academies</hi> of this our I≈øland, the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery</hi> and <hi>Military Gardens,</hi> who for Field-≈øervice have train'd up, and ≈øent forth many worthy, able and gallant Souldiers into the Armies lately rai≈øed in our Nation between the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> whom I pray God happily to reconcile. But, ≈øuppo≈øe many of the≈øe <hi>Doublings</hi> have not been ≈øeen by ≈øome to be u≈øed in the field; Are they not therefore u≈øeful? perhaps not at ≈øuch time they have had no occa≈øion for to u≈øe them all; which if not, mu≈øt they be rejected? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer po≈øitively, that being rightly enquired into, they have in them very u≈øeful and ≈øerviceable things again≈øt an Enemy, whether it be in the Field, or in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon. As for Example; the Muskettiers being brought either all into the Front or Reer, or upon one of the Flanks, which often hapneth, an Enemy appearing there, then they would be of ≈øigular good u≈øe for our advantage, and very di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to the Enemy. The like may be ≈øpoken of the Pikes, who are by ≈øeveral of the≈øe <hi>Doublings</hi> brought into tho≈øe places, being there very ≈øerviceable to receive a de≈øperate Charge of Hor≈øe, if upon any of the≈øe parts they ≈øhould fall on. Ob≈øerve, further, that in many of the≈øe Doublings, as the one arms ≈øhall face or charge again≈øt an Enemy, ≈øo contrariwi≈øe the other lies more ≈øecure in ≈øafety to be pre≈øerved from danger of the ≈øhot. Moreover, (according unto the number of men either in Length or Depth) a Leader may by the≈øe words of Command or the like, at the ≈øame time double his Front, Reer, or Mid≈øt, by dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of Ranks; and may farther make u≈øe of them at one and the ≈øame time to double by Files his right, left Flank and Mid≈øt, all at one in≈øtant. But I ≈øhall not need to ≈øet down words of Command for the doubling Front, Reer, Flanks and Mid≈øt, after this manner, but leave that unto the apt Souldier to make u≈øe of ≈øuch words of Command formerly ≈øhewen, and to frame them ≈øuitable for any ≈øuch purpo≈øe ≈øo intended. But before I ≈øhall conclude concerning the u≈øe of the≈øe Doublings, as I ≈øaid before, there are many of them, which by command will bring any men in the Body to fight, unto that part which ≈øhall be mo≈øt weak, or a≈ø≈øaulted by an enemy. And again, he may ca≈øt them ≈øo into the Body by a doubling, as ≈øhall pre≈øerve from danger whom he ≈øhall think fit. And to ≈øay more, there is no part of the Body or Arms but by words of Command in doublings may be brought forth as <hi>Frontiers</hi> again≈øt the enemy, and may be placed again into the mid≈øt of the Body for more ≈øecurity, and others in like manner may be brought forth for their relief. Therefore it much concerns all Souldiers and Commanders to be truly knowing in all the ≈øeveral kinds of Doublings, out of which he may make ≈øingular good u≈øe according to his di≈øcretion, at all ≈øuch times as need ≈øhall require, whether it be in Field, or otherwi≈øe in Garri≈øon.</p>

curio≈øity plainly to ≈øet down their ≈øeveral Commands, Directions, and Reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, keeping my former method concerning Doublings. For in all and every one of them, they do either double the length or depth of the Front, Reer, Mid≈øt, or Flanks; no part of the <hi>Military Exerci≈øe</hi> affording more plenty of matter then they, carrying always along with them many things of excellent u≈øe.

                     <p>Next come we to ≈øhew the excellent u≈øes and ≈øervices which may be performed by <hi>Conver≈øion,</hi> as fir≈øt perceiving any man of worth to ≈øtand before the Front of the Battail, or to pa≈øs by either of the Flanks, then Ranks ranking, or Files ranking into the Front, or Ranks wheeling to either of the Flanks, by the≈øe Commands the Souldiers a≈øpects are thither brought to pre≈øent unto him a volley of ≈øhot. It is likewi≈øe very u≈øeful for the making of a Line again≈øt a Brea≈øt-work, or lining of Hedges, carrying it ≈øelf ≈øeveral ways ≈øecretly to lie in <hi>Ambu≈øcado,</hi> whereby they may fire upon the Enemy as he marcheth by. Or approaching again≈øt any Fort or place of danger, they may daringly make a large Front and firing upon them; after filing to the right or left, making large Intervals, they much pre≈øerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves from the danger of the great ≈øhot proceeding from the Enemy. Again, Ranks ranking either in equal or unequal parts, is of ≈øingular good u≈øe upon a narrow pa≈ø≈øage, where they can march but two, three, four, or ≈øix abre≈øt; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, notwith≈øtanding they marched before twenty abre≈øt, may by it bring them to ≈øuch ≈ømall numbers, whereby he may much pre≈øerve them in time of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger and peril. To dwell no longer upon this di≈øcour≈øe, <hi>Inver≈øion</hi> and <hi>Conver≈øion</hi> many times require larger di≈øtance then any other of the Motions, as ≈øometimes double di≈øtance: or twice double di≈øtance, wherefore being ≈øo many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions for the u≈øe of them both, I hold it requi≈øite for a Leader frequently to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øe his Souldiers in them; no part of the <hi>Art Military</hi> affording more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations to the Souldiers that ≈øhall readily and hand≈øomly perform the ≈øame. Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore pa≈ø≈øing over what might be more ≈øpoken concerning them, I ≈øhall in the next place ≈øet them all forth in their full view, leaving every di≈øcreet Souldier to his own liberty, to make u≈øe of as many of them as he ≈øhall think fit, and to u≈øe them after what manner he plea≈øeth.</p>

                     <p>Yet before I enter in any other di≈øcour≈øe of the <hi>Art Military,</hi> I hold it requi≈øite to give ≈øome admonitions to tho≈øe that ≈øhall venture upon them.

Frequent practice therefore makes the Souldier expert, witne≈øs our gallant Souldiers and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who are mo≈øt of them ≈øo well grounded (by frequent practice) that their Leaders can ≈øcarce give a word of Command, which is not ea≈øily apprehended by them, they being in their exerci≈øes ≈øo often inured to ≈øuch difficult expre≈ø≈øions as the≈øe of Inver≈øion and Conver≈øion.</p>

                     <p>THo≈øe which have a longing de≈øire to be throughly knowing in this part or branch of <hi>Military Di≈øcipline,</hi> mu≈øt take notice of the≈øe four ≈øorts, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Counter-marching of Files, next of Ranks, after the Front and Reer-half-files, and la≈øtly, of right and left Half-ranks: all which are performed either by intire or Divi≈øional Counter-marches, or el≈øe by the intire changing of ground; and that by many ways, the Front-half-files with the Reer, the right Half-ranks with the left: So that an expert Leader may venter ≈øo far in them, as to continue his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe (without reducing) almo≈øt for an hour, and not to expre≈øs him≈øelf twice in any one word of Command; they affording ≈øuch plenty and variety in them, that with plea≈øure, u≈øing but four words of Command, he may bring each Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier into his proper place again; ob≈øerving the≈øe directions following. As fir≈øt, to look down in the Body, where his File-leaders are, and where his Bringers-up: &amp; likewi≈øe marking the ≈øeveral places of his Half-file-leaders, &amp; the Bringers up of his Front-half-files, together with his Flankers &amp; his middle Files: this ≈øpecial care being taken, he may begin and proceed to the Reducement, after this manner.</p>
                     <p>If by ≈øome former Counter-marches his File-leaders are in the place of his Half-file-leaders, and that his Bringers-up are in the room of the Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers-up of the Front-half-files, then he may proceed in this, or the like kinde,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108706:25"/>
commanding them to countermarch their Front and Reer into the mid≈øt; which being performed, they will ≈øtand in ≈øome pretty way of reducing; after facing them to the Front, where he meets with his Bringers-up, in ≈øtead of his File-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which by one Counter-march will bring them up again into the Front. Yet perhaps the Flankers have inter-changed ground with the middle File-leaders: if ≈øo, then Counter-march their Flanks into the mid≈øt, and face them to the Front: and if it happen that the right Flank is become the left, and the left the right; then Counter-march their Ranks to any hand, and after face them to the fir≈øt Front they are reduced. And farther, take this for a general rule, that when Files or Ranks Counter-march to any hand, command them to Counter-march to the contrary, and it will reduce them; or countermarching your Front and Reer into the mid≈øt, counter-marching of them back again from the mid≈øt will bring each man into his proper place again. The ≈øame rule being ob≈øerved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the Flankers, or Front and Reer-half-files, counter-marching of them from the mid≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Counter-marches rightly con≈øidered, branch them≈øelves forth into the≈øe three particulars.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Macedonian</hi> is a Counter-march of gaining ground, for that it leaveth the ground it formerly ≈øtood upon, and in lieu thereof taketh the ground before the Front, and turneth their A≈øpects unto the Reer.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> is a Counter-march of lo≈øing ground, for that it leaveth the ground it fir≈øt ≈øtood upon, and in room thereof, taketh the ground which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Reer; thither likewi≈øe altering the Souldiers A≈øpects.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chorean</hi> is a Counter-march maintaining ground, keeping the ground the Battalia formerly ≈øtood upon, every Souldier taking anothers place; it likewi≈øe turns the A≈øpect towards the Reer.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ≈øee (for all their great variety which latter ages have invented) they con≈øi≈øt but of three ≈øorts or kinds, either maintaining, gaining, or lo≈øing of ground; and may be performed (as I ≈øaid before) either by intire or divi≈øional Counter-marches.</p>
                     <p>It may now be expected that I declare unto the Souldier the meaning of each particular Counter-march; briefly therefore, thus: Files counter-marching is, when every Souldier followeth his Leader; Ranks counter-marching is, when every Souldier followeth his ≈øide-man, whether it be to the right-hand or to the left: Front and Reer-half-files counter-marching is, ≈øometimes when every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Souldier followeth his Leader or Bringer-up; or el≈øe when they follow their Half-file-leaders, or their Bringers-up of the Front-half-files, or the like: Right and left Half-ranks counter-marching is, when every Souldier in the Rank followeth the outmo≈øt men upon the right and left; or when they ≈øhall follow their in≈øide right and left-hand-men, or the like. What hath hitherto been ≈øpoken may be ≈øufficient, both for the in≈øtruction and direction of any di≈øcreet Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier: I come in the next place to ≈øet them all before them as they lie in Order.</p>

Yet by the way, give me leave fully to declare my ≈øelf concerning the u≈øe of them: for my opinion is, that of all the Motions tending to Martial Di≈øcipline, the≈øe may the be≈øt be ≈øpared, as being of little u≈øe, and not ≈øo much as practi≈øed abroad upon ≈øervice; and therefore the fewer of them any Leader ≈øhall u≈øe in his Exerci≈øe, in my judgement he doth the better, not ≈øpending time in needle≈øs ≈øpeeches, telling of his Souldiers that this is the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> this is the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> or <hi>Chorean Counter-march.</hi> Not to lie under the cen≈øure my ≈øelf of mi≈øpending time, I come therefore briefly in the next place to treat of Wheelings, being a ≈øubject more profitable for the intelligible Souldier.</p>

                     <p>HAving proceeded thus far in ≈øhewing all the ≈øeveral ≈øorts and kinds of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Motions, it will now in the next place be expected that I ≈øpeak ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Wheelings, and as formerly, ≈øo now, to ≈øet before the Souldier their ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds and u≈øes. Wherefore take notice of two ≈øorts, Wheelings Angular, and VVheelings on the Center, (which latter is commonly called the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his VVheeling) being acted or performed by the Souldier two ≈øeveral ways; that is to ≈øay, Intire or Divi≈øional.</p>
                     <p>Intire VVheelings to the Angles, are when the Souldiers turn their A≈øpects from the Front proper to either of the Flanks or Reer, whereby they may gain the VVind or Sun, or ≈øome like advantage, bringing their be≈øt Souldiers thither for to encounter an Enemy. For the better performance of this Motion, it will be convenient to clo≈øe Ranks and Files into the mid≈øt to order, and to keep their due di≈øtance both in Rank and File, ob≈øerving in their Ranks their right and left-hand-men, &amp; following their Leaders, always conforming them≈øelves in their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the mo≈øt commendable Po≈øture, which is Pikes advanced, &amp; Muskets poy≈øed. Wheeling the Battail on the Center, is when they are ≈øo ≈øtraightened with ground, that they have not room to wheel to the right or left, as in the former, which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108706:28"/>
gaineth as much more ground before the Front, as formerly they ≈øtood on. This Wheeling brings their be≈øt Souldiers to either of the Flanks or Reer. I could wi≈øh that this Wheeling were more often practi≈øed among≈øt us, for by it the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are better kept together in their Motion, being not ≈øo apt to flie out, as in the former.</p>
                     <p>Divi≈øional Wheelings (provided they have ≈øufficient number of men) are of ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular good u≈øe to encounter ≈øeveral Enemies at one and the ≈øame time, which the Front of our Battalia bringing our be≈øt Souldiers for to skirmi≈øh with them. It is likewi≈øe u≈øeful to bring either Arms into Front, Reer, or both the Flanks: for ≈øuppo≈øe the Muskettiers to be upon the Flanks, and fearing a de≈øperate charge of the Hor≈øe to fall upon them by a Divi≈øion of Wheeling, the Pikes are thither brought to receive their on-≈øet; and in the mean ≈øpace, the Muskettiers have time to recruit their Bandiliers again. Much more might be ≈øpoken, but my intent is not to fill my Book with impertinent di≈øcour≈øes, knowing what is already ≈øpoken is ≈øufficient for the intelligible Souldier.</p>

Now if any ≈øhall demand of me a rea≈øon why I have omitted the Reducements to each particular Command; my an≈øwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is ea≈øie: for as in the Counter-marches, ≈øo in the≈øe, they may be reduced by three or four words of Command, except a Commander ≈øhall of ≈øet purpo≈øe keep them off from the ≈øame, to make ≈øome experiment. After any wheeling is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, face them after to the fir≈øt Front, and command them to even their Ranks, and ≈øtraighten their Files, they will be as at fir≈øt; and unto what hand ≈øoever they wheeled, command them to wheel to the contrary hand, and they will be reduced unto the fir≈øt Front; or what part is wheeled off by Divi≈øion, wheel them inward again from that place, and it will ea≈øily reduce them. Thus you ≈øee that it is almo≈øt impo≈ø≈øible for a Leader to be out, unle≈øs he be extreamly ignorant; therefore he need not fear to venter far in the progre≈øs of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ≈øhall reduce them, provided he u≈øe no Doublings: which if he ≈øhall, great care mu≈øt be had that he be not put to a ≈øtand; for the prevention whereof, let him look back unto tho≈øe doublings by wheelings, wherein one doth reduce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where he may finde ≈øome remedy to help him≈øelf forth again.</p>

                     <p>The≈øe Firings may as well be performed to both Flanks as to one, the Body being faced accordingly, which would make many Firings more; but the≈øe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ≈øet down may be ≈øufficient for any ingenious capacity to work upon for the pre≈øent; ob≈øerving this rule, that in every Firing he ≈øhall make u≈øe of in time of his Exerci≈øe, he may reduce them by another; which will be more plea≈øing to the Souldier, by rea≈øon of the great variety it affords unto them. Now now in the la≈øt place, I know it will be expected, that I ≈øhould ≈øpeak ≈øomething of the u≈øe of Firings: wherefore briefly thus:</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Front marching or moving, when we either pur≈øue after, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to an Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Front, maintaining ground when two Bodies encounter one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Front, lo≈øing ground, when either we are forced thereunto by nece≈ø≈øity, or that we do it out of policy, to draw the Enemy into a train or ≈ønare.</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Reer marching, when we are pur≈øued by an Enemy, yet would continue our March until we have gained ≈øome place of importance or advantage.</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Reer upon a Stand, when we are compelled thereunto by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent pur≈øuit of an Enemy; or el≈øe when we have gained a place of advantage of ground, or have recovered the Wind or Sun, whereby we are the better able to encounter with them.</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Flank or Flanks marching, when we are a≈ø≈øaulted by ≈øome Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øcado ≈øecretly placed to hinder our pa≈ø≈øage; or ≈øuppo≈øing two Armies are marching to one and the ≈øame place, a River being betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>Firings to Flank or Flanks ≈øtanding, when the Enemy chargeth on with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution to cut off or divide part of the Army from the other.</p>
                     <p>Having thus briefly ≈øet down ≈øeveral Firings to Front, Reer and both Flanks, with their u≈øes, either marching or ≈øtanding: I hold it convenient in the next place to give ≈øome ≈øhort directions in time Battail, both to the Officers and their Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, that the Drummers have a vigilant eye upon their Commanders, who≈øe voices are drown'd by the loud thundring of the Cannon or Muskettiers; as al≈øo by the neighing of Hor≈øes, or the lamentable cries of the maim'd and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souldiers; at which time the Leaders Staff, Half-pike, or what el≈øe he carries in his hand, may be ≈øufficient for to in≈øtruct them to continue their charge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, or el≈øe to charge home.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the Serjeants be careful in time of Battail, that their Souldiers be at their due di≈øtance of order both in Rank and File; and that upon their Firings, whether they be Forlorns either of Files or Ranks drawn forth, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe by Divi≈øions, they ≈øee them neatly and hand≈øomely perform'd by cocking
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108706:30"/>
their Matches, and pre≈øenting ≈øomething lower then bre≈øt-high, and after Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocking and returning them, wheeling off either to the right, left, or both, falling in the Reer of them≈øelves, or el≈øewhere as ≈øhall be appointed, in an orderly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereby they may decently come up again to Fire again≈øt the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that the Souldiers pre≈øent and give fire upon their Re≈øts, not u≈øing that ≈ølovenly po≈øture of popping their Matches into the Pan, their Muskets being on their left ≈øides; which is not onely hurtful unto them≈øelves, but much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers their Fellow-≈øouldiers; and by ≈øo doing, they ≈øcarce or ever do any execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again≈øt an Enemy. But here I meet with an objection framed by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers after this manner: Our Re≈øts are of little or no u≈øe unto us in time of skirmi≈øhing; fit they are, we confe≈øs, in the Military Gardens, but in time of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail both trouble≈øome and cumber≈øome unto us. To whom I reply, what if they be a little cumber≈øome at fir≈øt, mu≈øt they therefore be rejected and carele≈øly thrown away? nay, rather they ought frequently to practice them≈øelves in the u≈øe thereof; which if they did, they would finde the ≈øame very ≈øerviceable unto them in the time of skirmi≈øhing; wherewith they Fire better, and in a more comely and graceful way, far more ≈øecuring both them≈øelves and Fellow-≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from danger; and likewi≈øe upon their March it is both a help and ≈øupport unto them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, their eyes ought likewi≈øe in time of Battail to be fixed ≈øtedfa≈øtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Captain, always conforming to him in Po≈øture when he ≈øhall prepare to charge or retreat; and likewi≈øe they ought to be knowing and well ver≈øt in the ≈øeveral Beats of the Drum; which if well ob≈øerved by all, there would not be ≈øo much confu≈øion in time of Battail among≈øt them, as many times by ≈øad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath been found, when di≈øregarding their Officers commands and the bearing of the Drum, they ignorantly and ra≈øhly run on in a di≈øorderly manner; by which means they have cut off their own Officers and Fellow-≈øouldiers, many times, more then they have dangered the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ≈øee what great nece≈ø≈øity there is of in≈øtructing and training up the Souldiers in their Po≈øtures; and how requi≈øite it is to conform them≈øelves to their Officers in time of Battail, performing thereby better execution again≈øt their Enemies; and by their decent and comely array pre≈øerve them≈øelves from eminent dangers and perils.</p>
                     <p>The Souldiers having now all the ground-work of the exerci≈øing a Body of men laid down before them, in the next place he labours to make experiment thereof; but being no Officer, he cannot attain thereunto without ≈øpecial leave from his Superiours; and therefore (being a File-leader) he craves leave for to exerci≈øe his ≈øingle File both in their Po≈øtures and Motions, contenting him≈øelf for pre≈øent with that ≈ømall number, whereby he is able to run through many plain things of Di≈øtances, Facings, Doublings, Counter-marchings and Wheelings. But being not fully ≈øatisfied, he pre≈øumes upon the former favour had from his Superiours, to go on to make every man in his File a File-leader; fir≈øt by ≈øucce≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and after (being not called away by the beat of the Drum, or by his Officers, to lead up his File and to joyn into a Body) according unto Dignity, and after endeavours to reduce them again by proper words of command.</p>
                     <p>This liberty being granted at convenient times unto a File-leader, much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers the Souldiers good affections unto their Officers; and is a means whereby many others are brought in to be true lovers of Military Exerci≈øe, as being much taken and well plea≈øed with the ≈øight of the former things. And therefore, I could wi≈øh that they were not hereafter prevented, as formerly I have ob≈øerved by the malice of ≈øome, who have had places of command be≈øtowed upon them, more through favour, or by rea≈øon of their riches, then for any worth or de≈øert found in them: They perhaps hold it a great di≈øpargement unto them to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clip≈øed; but a judicious and di≈øcreet Captain accounts it a great honour to lead ≈øuch gallant men that are as able and as well knowing as him≈øelf.</p>

                     <p>Although I have here ≈øet down words of Command to make every man a File-leader, both by Succe≈ø≈øion and Dignity, a Commander is not thereby tyed up, but may, if he plea≈øe, practi≈øe the ≈øame upon a whole Company, altering but a little ≈øome words of Command. As for Example, we cannot ≈øay in a File, Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Ranks, there being none, until there be ≈øome other Files joyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: and therefore if we intend a doubling by a ≈øingle File, we command it to rank two to the right or left, which in a Company mu≈øt be expre≈øt, Ranks to the right or left double. Thus you ≈øee with a little alteration every man is brought up into the Front, either by Succe≈ø≈øion or Dignity; whether the Files be even numbers or odd, great bodies or ≈ømall. But here by the way, I mu≈øt crave pardon to ≈øpeak ≈øomething in commendation of the≈øe Doublings, in an≈øwer to them that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them but Toys: to whom I will be ≈øo bold as to tell them, that it is not for want of ignorance they ≈øo ≈ølightly e≈øteem of them; for were they truly knowing in the Art of Drilling, they mu≈øt of force confe≈øs abundance of variety in them, affording much delight to him that ≈øhall command, and great content unto them that are commanded, perceiving them≈øelves to be made File-leaders by the skill and worth of their Leaders. And be≈øides, there may be ju≈øt cau≈øe (at one time or other) many times to alter the Ranks, exchanging the one for the other, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby their be≈øt de≈øerving Souldiers into the chiefe≈øt places of honour; and ca≈øting others into their rooms at the di≈øcretion of the Commander. Therefore, I could wi≈øh all Leaders what≈øoever to be well skill'd and ver≈øt in the≈øe Doublings; the frequent practice whereof will make them more apt in the Exerci≈øe of more difficult things in the <hi>Art Military.</hi> To which ingenious ≈øtudy, I leave them; and in the next place proceed to ≈øhew them ≈øeveral Figures of Battail to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ≈øingle Files, con≈øi≈øting of ≈øeveral Depths of men.</p>

                     <p>THe great plenty and variety of matter that may be performed in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øing of a ≈øingle File, makes me wonder at the ignorance of tho≈øe who are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108706:32"/>
famed abroad for able knowing Souldiers; who after they have pa≈ø≈øed over the Po≈øtures are at a ≈øtand, as if there were nothing el≈øe to be done with the ≈øame. But did they truely under≈øtand what di≈øhonour and di≈øparagement it is unto them, they would not be ≈øo idle and backward, but ≈øet times a part, often inuring them≈øelves to the practice thereof, going through all the Motions, Di≈øtances, Facings, Doublings, Counter-marches and Wheelings; and may farther, if he plea≈øe, with his ≈øingle File draw forth divers Figures of Battail, declaring unto his Souldiers their ≈øeveral rea≈øons and u≈øes. The exerci≈øing his Company after this manner, affords unto them both content and delight; and it is likewi≈øe very u≈øeful in greater Bodies, when time of need ≈øhall require, as ≈øhall appear in the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this Book.</p>
                     <p>But here, me thinks, I hear ≈øome ≈øay, Of what u≈øe are your Figures? ≈øeeing for the mo≈øt part in pitcht Battails, or skirmi≈øhes in the field, they commonly fire one again≈øt another in Square, or by Forlorns drawn forth from the Body, and being relieved, return into their places again. To whom, I an≈øwer, that in one re≈øpect it is true, there being ≈øcarce any pitcht Battail in the field fought in the≈øe latter times, but it hath been with even Fronts, who are fir≈øt engaged; whether it be by Divi≈øions drawn off by way of Forlorns, Wings or Battail, they fight with even Fronts or Squadrons, as having every five or ≈øix Files divided a part from each other, having ≈øix foot ground interval betwixt the above≈øaid number of Files for the conveniency of the Ranks, wheeling off after they have fired. As concerning ≈øuch Figures as are framed like the Wedge, Saw, Sheers, or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; I mu≈øt confe≈øs there is little or no u≈øe at all, except it be for delight, or for the practice and experience of ≈øome young Souldier, whereby he may plainly ≈øee the cu≈øtom of the Ancients in ≈øetting forth ≈øuch ancient Figures. But to let this pa≈øs, and to come to the place where we left; I ≈øhall ≈øhew unto the Souldier how needful it is for him to be well skilled in the framing of Figures of Battail, and likewi≈øe to be throughly acquainted with their ≈øeveral u≈øes. Wherefore take this for a general rule, that there was never any pitcht Battail, but there were Re≈øerves appointed out unto all the parts thereof, whereby they might bring off, and at time of need relieve each other; and if ≈øo, certainly they mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity carry along with them ≈øeveral forms and Figures of Battail, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the di≈øcretion of the Major-general, or the Commanders in chief whom it ≈øhall concern. It will therefore be expedient (≈øince there is a nece≈ø≈øity of Figures of Battail, and for the ≈øetting apart of Divi≈øions for the relieving of each other) for every Commander that will be truely knowing, to have always ≈øome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in his memory; that in time of need, he may not be to ≈øeek, or wanting in them. To which purpo≈øe I have collected ≈øome few, putting them to their view, being formerly practi≈øed by me, for the ≈øatisfaction of tho≈øe loving Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen which have private Meetings in <hi>London;</hi> but more e≈øpecially for tho≈øe of the <hi>Town-ditch,</hi> unto whom I am e≈øpecially bound. And therefore without more delay, I ≈øhall lay before them certain Figures of Battail upon all the Depths of Files ≈øet forth in the former Table, leaving them to their own di≈øcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make u≈øe of what ≈øhall be≈øt comply, and ≈øuit to their intended purpo≈øe.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Artillery Gardens</hi> de≈øerves the fir≈øt place, in re≈øpect it is the greate≈øt Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from whence, as it were out of a <hi>Nur≈øery,</hi> have been tran≈øplanted many able knowing Souldiers both at home and in foraign Countries, to the great honour of our Nation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Military Garden</hi> is famous likewi≈øe for the great improvement of divers worthy per≈øons of quality daily thither re≈øorting, who≈øe excellent skill in <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Exerci≈øes hath rai≈øed many of them to high preferment here at home, and to places of honourable command abroad. The Captains in chief of the≈øe Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are Major General <hi>Skippon,</hi> and Major <hi>Henry Tyllier,</hi> which later was the fir≈øt that ever ≈øhewed in the <hi>Military Garden</hi> (of which I am a member) the march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Souldiers in a Regimental way; who≈øe great pains among≈øt us de≈øerves much honour and high commendation; ≈øhewing unto us ≈øuch variety of matter in a Souldier-like way, as was never before ≈øeen by any member thereof.</p>
                     <p>Not to eclip≈øe the fore-mentioned <hi>Private Meetings</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> but to give them that due which belongs unto them, they likewi≈øe are of great honour and fame for their frequent exerci≈øing of their Souldiers in the handling of their <hi>Arms,</hi> whether it be of the <hi>Pike</hi> or <hi>Musket,</hi> and in≈øtructing them in the knowledge of <hi>Drilling,</hi> and drawing up of Companies, and Bodies of men, furni≈øhing both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms with able knowing Souldiers. My hearty wi≈øhes therefore are, that all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them may be propt up, and ≈øupported to all ages, that when need ≈øhall require, we may draw from the≈øe <hi>Fountains</hi> ≈øuch skilful and experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Officers as may be, as it were, a Bulwark to this our Nation.</p>
                     <p>Not to dwell any longer upon this di≈øcour≈øe, I come therefore briefly to ≈øet forth ≈øeveral Exerci≈øes (formerly practi≈øed by me among≈øt tho≈øe loving Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Town-ditch</hi>) according to the u≈øual numbers there appearing, whether they be great or ≈ømall, practi≈øed for the mo≈øt part with 24 or 32 men, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (although ≈øeldom) with 64 men, unle≈øs it were upon general days, when they were drawn forth into the field; at ≈øuch times, perhaps, there might be an appearance of greater numbers, as 120 and upwards.</p>
                     <p>My purpo≈øe therefore is to pitch upon, and to make u≈øe of all and every one
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108706:37"/>
of the≈øe numbers, making 12 Exerci≈øes, dividing them by threes, until I have run over them all, conceiving them ≈øufficient for the indu≈øtrious to gather from thence matter enough for his intended Exerci≈øe. And for the more enabling of them, I ≈øhall endeavour (in the≈øe curious times) to walk along in as plain a way as po≈ø≈øibly may be, giving directions unto all Words of Command, for the better performance of the ≈øame; wi≈øhing all my loving fellow-Souldiers to conceive well of my good meaning intended to them: de≈øiring withall to be rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of what part ≈øoever they fall upon, that they proceed lea≈øurely and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in the ≈øame; which will not only be an encouragement unto the Author from whom they gather their Exerci≈øes, but will bring much prai≈øes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to them≈øelves. But to leave every one to their own be≈øt thoughts, while≈øt I proceed to practi≈øe what before promi≈øed concerning the ≈øeveral Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øes following.</p>

                     <p>HE that ≈øhall be de≈øirous to be truly knowing in this point of <hi>Military Di≈øcipline,</hi> in the drawing up of Regiments, whether they be of le≈ø≈øer or greater Bodies, as in ≈øome 6, others 7, 8, 10, or 12 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, they mu≈øt be drawn up into <hi>Battalia,</hi> either in one, two, or three Squadrons (or grand Divi≈øions) of Pikes flanked with Muskettiers, having always in the Reer a ≈øufficient number of Muskettiers for the guard of the Bagage, Cannon, or to be Convoys for to convey Ammunition and Victual to the re≈øt of their fellows; who are to be drawn forth (by the di≈øcretion of the Major) from each particular Company, according to their ≈øeveral ≈øtrengths, as in greater Companies more Files then in tho≈øe which be le≈ø≈øer, ordering them timely relief, whereby the ≈øeveral duties among≈øt the Souldiers throughout the Regiment by an equal way may take their turns. Now for as much as the true ≈øtating of the Dignities of every particular Officer, in the opinions of many, differ very much, and our former Military Authors have been very ≈øparing in their pains in ≈øetting down their due places of honour; I ≈øhall, for ≈øatisfaction of tho≈øe which de≈øire to be rightly informed, collect out of the many forms practi≈øed abroad and at home, one good way to perfect it.</p>
                     <p>But here, by the way, I mu≈øt crave pardon from the courteous Reader, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon I fore≈øee certain Objections like rubs or blocks lying in my way, to digre≈øs a little from my intended purpo≈øe, to give an≈øwers unto each of them: which are,</p>

                     <p>The opinions of Souldiers in the drawing up of Regiments are very various both in their Forms and Figures, according to the cu≈øtom of their Countreys, commands of their Generals, or Officers in chief, which neverthele≈øs may prove very good and ≈øerviceable when need ≈øhall require.

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The manner of drawing up a Regiment con≈øi≈øting of ≈øix Companies, containing in it a <hi>Colonel,</hi> a <hi>Lieutenant-Colonel,</hi> a <hi>Major,</hi> and three <hi>Captains,</hi> every one having <hi>108</hi> men in a Company, and the three Field-Officers <hi>144.</hi> which makes compleatly up <hi>756</hi> men, whereof two thirds are Muskettiers, and one third of Pikes, the Files being ≈øix deep.</head>
                     <p>THe general place of Rendezvous being appointed out unto the Major, it is his care to take a timely view thereof, that there be ground and room ≈øufficient enough for the drawing them up. And having received Orders from his Colonel, Major General, or other ≈øuperiour Officers for the Regiments marching thither, he may appoint the Companies to march either of the≈øe two ways, either by ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion or dignity. If by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, fir≈øt the Colonels Company moves away; next the Lieutenant Colonels in the Reer of him; then the Majors, and ≈øo con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all the re≈øt from the elde≈øt to the younge≈øt, who brings up the Reer of all. If by Dignity, fir≈øt the Colonels Company; and in the Reer of him, the younge≈øt Captain; and after him the elde≈øt; then the Majors; then the ≈øecond Captain; the Lieutenant Colonel bringing up the Reer of all. But it concerns the Major before their marching to give notice to the Lieutenant Colonel and the elde≈øt Captain to countermarch their Ranks of their two particular Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as ≈øoon as they come into the place of the general Rendezvous before he ≈øhall draw them up, to pre≈øerve the honour of the right File-leaders, and Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers up of both Arms. He is likewi≈øe to be there beforehand, attending their marching in, and after the Colonels Company have made Alt, to draw up each particular Company on the left of him, all in one even range, commanding them to clo≈øe Ranks forward to Order, and Files into the mid≈øt unto the ≈øame di≈øtance. He is likewi≈øe to inform him≈øelf of the Captains, Lieutenants, and Serjeants, how many Files of Pikes and Muskettiers they have in each particular Company, and accordingly he is to enter it down in his Paper-Book, and to make u≈øe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as followeth.</p>
                     <p>He is to require one ≈øingle File apiece of Muskettiers to be drawn off from the three ≈ømalle≈øt Companies, and two Files apiece from the greater, which makes nine Files, and contains 54 men, which are to be led away by an able Serjeant into the Reer, for to be a guard to the Bagage, or other occa≈øions. From thence he may proceed, commanding all the Muskettiers to ≈øtand, and the Pikes to advance their Arms, and move forward ten or twelve paces; and then to ≈øtand, and clo≈øe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108706:73"/>
their Files outward to Order; three of their Colours moving with their Pikes to the right hand; the other three moving away to the left. After he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Muskettiers to clo≈øe their Files outward to Order, and they will ≈øtand in four Divi≈øions, two of Pikes, and in the Reer of them, two of Muskettiers, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath is ≈øet forth; the Captains being all upon the head of the Pikes, with their En≈øigns, and the Lieutenants in the Reer; the Serjeants attending upon the Flanks of each divi≈øion.</p>

                     <p>This being done, command each divi≈øion of Muskettiers and Pikes to face out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to move to ≈øuch convenient di≈øtance, that being faced to the Front, there may be room ≈øufficient upon the ≈øubdividing of each divi≈øion of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers for their moving up, and flanking each body of Pikes. After which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor may a≈ø≈øign unto every Captain and Lieutenant his due place of honour, as they ≈øtand all abre≈øt; and that they may al≈øo naturally fall into their proper places upon the march, which ≈øhall be ≈øet forth in the next Figure ≈øtanding in two grand Divi≈øions, the one in the Reer of the other, which may happen ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for want of ground; but provided they have ground enough, they ought to ≈øtand in one even range, as in <hi>folio</hi> 5. The Major, after they are thus drawn up in one even range, will finde three Files of Muskettiers more in the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion, and two of the Pikes, then is in the fir≈øt; therefore he mu≈øt take from thence one File of each Company, and add them to nine Files in the Reer, which maketh them twelve, and then he will have ballanced the divi≈øions equal, taking off one File of Pikes, and placing it amon≈øt the elde≈øt Captains Pikes.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Rea≈øons follow for the placing of the Captains, their Colours, and their Lieutenants, after the manner before ≈øet down.</head>
                     <p>WHat hath formerly been declared concerning a Rank or File, ≈øix abre≈øt, or ≈øix deep, may be ≈øatisfactory in ≈øome kind unto this point, which takes his rule from hence. For all private Companies, ≈ømaller Bodies, or ≈øingle Files, mu≈øt, or ought to be as neer as they can conformable to greater Bodies, as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, and con≈øequently they to Brigades. Therefore take notice that this rule ought ever to be ob≈øerved in the drawing of Regiments, that the right Flank, as neer as may be, ought to be ≈øuitable with the left, both in ≈øtrength, number, and dignity; and likewi≈øe to be ≈øo when they are drawn forth upon a long march, the Front equal with the Reer. Now, ≈øuppo≈øe the≈øe two grand divi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ≈øtood even abre≈øt; we will begin to examine the fir≈øt worth, which is the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; and the fourth worth, which is the elde≈øt Captains, and placed upon the right and left of the fir≈øt grand divi≈øion, with the ≈øecond and third worth, who are the Lieutenant-Colonel and Major, drawn up upon the right and left of the ≈øecond grand divi≈øion; and you ≈øhall finde they are every way equivalent in number, worth and dignity, with that of the fir≈øt.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, there are no more to place, but the fifth and ≈øixth worth, who are the ≈øecond and third Captains: and therefore ≈øince it is the fir≈øt place of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour among the Captains in a Regiment, to lead the fir≈øt Body or Stand of Pikes; it mu≈øt then con≈øequently follow, that the ≈øecond place of honour mu≈øt be to lead the ≈øecond grand divi≈øion of Pikes; and therefore the fifth worth is brought into and placed between the ≈øecond and third, that he may ≈øtand there to lead the ≈øecond Body of Pikes; wherein the Lieutenant-Colonel, the Major, and his own Colours are placed: ≈øo that there remains no more but the ≈øixth worth, or younge≈øt Captain to place, who is to be drawn up between the Colonel and elde≈øt Captain. Now if we ≈øhall further proceed to ballance it more cleerly, con≈øider them by dividing them by two's in their places; as fir≈øt, we will begin with the Colonel, the fir≈øt worth, who hath joyned to him the younge≈øt Captain, which is the ≈øixth worth, and they two make the number (7); then compare the Lieutenant-Colonel, who is the ≈øecond worth, unto the ≈øecond Captain joyn'd with him, which is the fifth worth, and they make alike the ≈øame number; after that compare the Major and elder Captain, who are drawn up into the mid≈øt of the Regiment, who≈øe places carry the third and fourth worth, and their number is ≈øuitable with the re≈øt. And thus much may be ≈øpoken in general: now I ≈øhall come more particularly to give further ≈øatisfaction, both for them, and for all the re≈øt; and therefore I will give rea≈øons for the placing of the Officers of the fir≈øt grand divi≈øion; and cleering that, the ≈øecond will quickly be laid open to the view.</p>

                     <p>IN this grand Divi≈øion, there is the Colonel, the elde≈øt Captain, and the younge≈øt drawn up into the mid≈øt, and they having each of them Lieutenants; take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice therefore of the≈øe rea≈øons for their placing thus; That always upon ≈øuch ≈ømall Bodies as the≈øe, the fir≈øt honour is ever placed upon the right, and the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond upon the left; and that which remains, mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity be drawn up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mid≈øt; they ≈øtanding all abre≈øt. The≈øe three Companies being ordered into a right and left Flank, and one Stand of Pikes, or Van-guard, Reer-ward, or Main-battail, as they may be term'd, the rea≈øons follow for the thus ≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Officers, whether marching all even abre≈øt, or upon a ≈øtand: it is the Colonels proper place to be on the head or mid≈øt of his grand divi≈øion; which is his chiefe≈øt place of ≈øecurity, and where he ought to fight; for ≈øtanding there, the other may more conveniently repair unto him for their orders, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion ≈øhall require. Now the Colonel being a Field-Officer, is not ab≈øolutely tyed to any one place to fight, as the re≈øt are, many occa≈øions calling him from
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108706:74"/>
thence; the elde≈øt Captain therefore is appointed to take charge of the Body of Pikes, whether it be upon a March to lead them, or upon a Stand to fight them, he ought never to for≈øake them, but upon ≈øpecial command from his Colonel, or other Field-Officers. Now the rea≈øon why the fir≈øt Body of Pikes is the mo≈øt honourable≈øt place to lead, is, as I conceive, becau≈øe the Colonels Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are there flying; and be≈øides, being the more ancienter Arms, far more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it is to lead them; for mo≈øt commonly the gallante≈øt men of the Infantry de≈øire rather to trail Pikes, then to carry Muskets. Moreover, it hath been a con≈øtant practi≈øe in mo≈øt places, that the elde≈øt Captain ≈øhould have that place to lead on foot, although many times his Colonel being on hor≈øe-back, may be a little before him. Having ≈øpoken of the≈øe two, it remains to ≈øpeak ≈øomething of the younge≈øt Captain, who is appointed either upon the Marching all abre≈øt, or upon a Stand, to take charge of the Reer-ward, or left Flank of the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to fight them; but upon the long March, it is more honourable for him to fall down in the Reer, and to bring up his own Lieutenant, coming up into his place; for it is greater honour (though many times not believed) to bring up a grand divi≈øion, then to lead a Sub-divi≈øion. In the next place, it may be ≈øuppo≈øed that the Captain-Lieutenants place is too honourable to lead the Van-guard. To which I an≈øwer, That the Colonel him≈øelf is confined thither; for upon the long March he draws off the Van-guard, and leads them him≈øelf, being attended on hor≈øe-back by the Martial and Quarter-ma≈øter of his own Regiment. Now lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Muskettiers of his own particular Company, the Captain-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being ≈øub≈øervient unto him, marcheth a foot upon the head of the fir≈øt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion of Muskettiers, and takes charge of them, as a≈ø≈øi≈øting to his Colonel, and fighting them, if he receives no command to the contrary, when they are all drawn up again even abre≈øt, it concerning him e≈øpecially to be there re≈øident in the ab≈øence of his Colonel, for the better regulating of them. The elde≈øt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Lieutenant is always placed in the Reer of the Pikes, either upon a Stand, or upon a March, it being very honourable unto him to bring up a grand Divi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pikes. The third Captains Lieutenant is ordered to bring up the left Flank, except it be upon the long March, and then he is to exchange places with his own Captain. There is yet one place vacant, which is to bring up the right Flank; and the Captain-Lieutenants Bringer-up many times through courte≈øie is called a Lieutenant, therefore a Major may be ≈øo courteous as to a≈ø≈øign him that place. And here I ≈øhall conclude with the rea≈øons of the places of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion.</p>

                     <p>ALthough the Colonel is Commander in chief, yet his di≈øcretion is ≈øuch, as to leave the ordering of places to his Major; and as he takes charge of the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion, ≈øo he leaves the ≈øecond to his Lieutenant-Colonel, who ≈øtands upon the head or mid≈øt of the ≈øame, being drawn up all even abre≈øt; and many times leads the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion, as the Colonel doth the fir≈øt, as was the practi≈øe in the Regiments upon their March under the command of the Earl of <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> General of the Parliaments Forces. To ≈øuch as ≈øhall approve of this way (which may be very good) they ≈øhall not need to Counter-march the Ranks of the Lieutenant-Colonel, as is before expre≈ø≈øed, before the drawing up of the Lieutenant-Colonels Company, but draw them up on the right of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion, and to Counter-march the Ranks of the Majors, and draw his Company up on the left. But I ≈øhall leave that to the liberty of tho≈øe that ≈øhall be≈øt fancie this kinde, and proceed to that which is of more u≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion ≈øtanding in an even range with the fir≈øt, it will be convenient for the Lieutenant-Colonel to be upon the head thereof. As concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Major, he being an Officer at will, hath no certain place a≈ø≈øign'd unto him, by rea≈øon of his moving as occa≈øion ≈øhall require to both Divi≈øions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108706:75"/>
he may give orders unto them all, minding the good order of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment throughout every part. But if he will take his place, to march in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere≈øt place for him, if they march all abre≈øt, will be in the Front, between the Colonel and Lieutenant-Colonel; but in the long march, in the mid≈øt of both grand Divi≈øions, whereby he may have freer acce≈øs unto them both, who≈øe vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eye in the well ordering of the Regiment is chiefly concern'd, ob≈øerving all the pa≈ø≈øages, whether there be need of ≈øub-dividing their Divi≈øions; and if at any time they ≈øhall be divided, when there is ground ≈øufficient enough, he mu≈øt give order again for the drawing them all up even abre≈øt, it being far more graceful to the Regiments marching. In the next place, the ≈øecond Captain may claim it as his due, to lead the ≈øecond Body of Pikes, as the elde≈øt Captain challengeth the fir≈øt; and the rea≈øon given for his place, may ≈øuffice for both. The elde≈øt Lieutenant in this grand Divi≈øion, which is the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieutenant, is a≈ø≈øigned unto that place, where he is ≈øet down for to be an a≈ø≈øi≈øtant there unto his Lieutenant-Colonel, for the well regulating of his men which march in the Reer, as the Captain-Lieutenant is to the Colonels men, who march in the Front; and his Lieutenant-Colonel bringing up the whole Regiment, is the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place of honour. Some may conceive the Majors Lieutenant hath too great a place of honour in leading the Van of the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion. To which I an≈øwer, If the Lieutenant-Colonel marcheth not there him≈øelf, but ≈øhall bring up the Regiment; certainly it mu≈øt be cleer, that it is the Majors due, for to march there him≈øelf at times convenient; and being ≈øo, there is good rea≈øon in his ab≈øence his Lieutenant ≈øhould lead his men, or in his pre≈øence to be there as a helper unto him, for the well regulating of his men, as the other Lieutenants are to the other Field-Officers, who every one of them according to their ≈øeveral places may have ≈øeveral occa≈øions to call them off; their Lieutenants therefore ought to be at hand, and to march with them in their places, whereby they may receive Orders from them, and know how to act in their ab≈øence concerning their own particular Souldiers. The ≈øecond Captains Lieutenant is ordered to bring up the ≈øecond Body of Pikes; which being a grand Divi≈øion, it falls to him as due there, as the elde≈øt Captains Lieutenant doth in the fir≈øt, it being the greate≈øt place of honour that can be given him in the Reer, next to the Lieutenant-Colonel. Having ≈øpoken thus much concerning every Field-Officer, the Captains and their Lieutenants, where their places are to march, with the rea≈øons for the ≈øame, it will be expected to ≈øupply two places which are vacant in the Reer of the ≈øecond grand divi≈øion. To which I an≈øwer, Upon the long march the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonel him≈øelf moves down there, and brings up the Reer of the whole Regiment; and therefore it is left vacant for him. But then you will ≈øay, There wants an Officer to bring up the Reer of that Divi≈øion wherein the Majors Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant is placed. To which I an≈øwer, That there is none remaining to do it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be the Majors Lieutenant him≈øelf. For if the Major ≈øhall lead the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion, then his Lieutenant may move down to bring up that particular Divi≈øion for to ≈øupply the ≈øame; but in regard the Major (as hath been ≈øhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) hath many occa≈øions to call him off, it concerns his Lieutenant to keep his place which was fir≈øt a≈ø≈øigned unto him, to avoid the trouble of moving up again in his Majors ab≈øence. Some are of opinion it would be convenient to place the Lieutenant-Colonels elde≈øt Serjeant there; but in my judgement, it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand≈øome to ≈øee any Halberdeer, either to lead or bring up any Divi≈øion march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Regimental way; and rather then I ≈øhould do it, I would let it go un≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; but if he ≈øhall be there placed to bring up, his be≈øt way of marching is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Pallizado, or half-pike, and not with his Halberd.</p>

from him. The Souldiers being warned thereby, begin to ≈øhoulder their Arms, and prepare to move; the Colonel on Horsback being attended on by his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Quarter-ma≈øter, draws off the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Lieutenant being ≈øix foot behinde him; which Divi≈øion is brought up by the Captain-Lieutenants Bringer-up. The elde≈øt Captain follows next, leading the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Pikes, and brought up by his own Lieutenant. The next Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Muskettiers is led by the third Captains Lieutenant, and the Reer of the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion is brought up by the third Captain. There ought to be full 18 foot of ground betwixt each Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion; he that brings up a Divi≈øion, ought to be cleer ≈øix foot behinde the ≈øame; and he that leads, to be ≈øix foot before; ≈øo that there will be ≈øix foot proportion of ground betwixt them both, for the better di≈øtingui≈øhing of their Divi≈øions, the Leaders and Bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers-up thereof. And where there is not room ≈øufficient for the marching ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abre≈øt, as they are now ordered, they mu≈øt ≈øubdivide, being careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve their Divi≈øions, marching in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter depths, at their due di≈øtance of open order in rank, and order in file. For the Serjeants mu≈øt not pre≈øume upon any ≈øub-dividing to bring them down in the Reer of them that march before, and keep them intire in all their re≈øpective Divi≈øions. And it mu≈øt be their ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to attend upon the Flanks, even abre≈øt with tho≈øe Leaders of Files that were taken off; that when there is ground and room enough, they more readier know where to finde them, and to lead them up again as they were at fir≈øt. Care likewi≈øe mu≈øt be had upon any ≈øub-dividing of the Pikes, that there be none of the Colours divided, who are in a Regimental way to march all three together, according to their fir≈øt placing. The≈øe rules and ob≈øervations concern both grand Divi≈øions. Now the fir≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led away, as is before expre≈øt, there ought to be ≈øufficient ground betwixt each grand Divi≈øion for the leading of the Carriages; and in the fir≈øt place there is to be con≈øidered, that to mo≈øt Regiments there is allowed two Waggons, for the Baggage and Ammunition, and two Field-pieces, or great Cannon, be≈øides other Carriages which more concern the Victual for the Souldiers, as occa≈øion ≈øhall require: now concerning the ordering, and ≈øecure≈øt placing of all the≈øe upon the March, will be in the mid≈øt of the Regiment, and to have tho≈øe which are ordred for their Guard, to be Fire-locks, or to have Snap-hances, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of the danger which might happen by the Cole of the Match; and being placed where any attempt of the Enemy ≈øhall fall on, either to Front, Reer, or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108706:76"/>
either Flank, the Cannon may thus be ea≈øily drawn forth to fire upon them; and all the wood of the Carriages, with their Guard, to be ordred in the Reer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the a≈ø≈øault ≈øhould happen, for their better ≈øecurity and ≈øafety. The Major in the next place, if he plea≈øe, may lead the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion; to which purpo≈øe he draws off (with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of his own Lieutenant) the fir≈øt Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Muskettiers, his Lieutenant being ≈øix foot behinde him, and ≈øo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Muskettiers. The next that follows, is the ≈øecond Body of Pikes, which is led by the ≈øecond Captain, and brought up by his own Lieutenant. The la≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers is led by the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieutenant: and the Reer of the whole Regiment is brought up by the Lieutenant-Colonel. The Serjeants are to march upon the Flanks, attending their own men, that when they are to be reduced into Companies, they may know more readier where to finde them; and according to order they may draw them off to compleat up their Captains Companies. As for the Drums, the care thereof belongs to the Drum-Major to place, and to ea≈øe them timely by reliefs, to beat as many or as few as he ≈øhall think fit; to which purpo≈øe, he orders them to fall in betwixt the ≈øecond and third Rank of Muskettiers and Pikes of each Divi≈øion; but when they are all even abre≈øt, the Drums are placed according as you ≈øee them marked. The Figure for the long-March in the next place followeth.</p>

                     <p>THe Major finding the commodiou≈øne≈øs of the ground, may draw them up all even abre≈øt again, and proceed to exerci≈øe them in a Regimental way, conferring before-hand with the Captains, Lieutenants, En≈øigns, and Serjeants, what he intends to do. Whether he will exerci≈øe every Maniple, or Divi≈øion (as is u≈øual in a private Company) in all their plain Motions and Firings, which may be very proper, and ea≈øily done, or otherwi≈øe proceed to more variety in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Divi≈øion, to give them commands as one man, either to face, double, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe according to di≈øcretion. And having fully in≈øtructed them of all his intents and purpo≈øes, he mu≈øt begin to con≈øider of the be≈øt manner for the managing of the ≈øame. To which end, he ≈øhall do well to command the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion to advance forward 12 paces clear of the ≈øecond, and after face them to the Front, and they will ≈øtand in manner as in Folio 147. After he mu≈øt con≈øider how many Files of Muskettiers there are, and whether he can branch them forth into equal Divi≈øions ≈øutable to the Pikes; but finding them to ≈øtand but 18 of a ≈øide, he ≈øhall do well for time of his Exerci≈øe, to draw off eight Files of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers from the Reer, which were formerly appointed to guard the Ammunition, or Baggage, and add two to every Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, which will make them 20 Files of each ≈øide of the Pikes, and then he may thus proceed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Command.</hi> Files, to their open order, and Ranks to clo≈øe forward to order in each grand Divi≈øion: every five Files of Muskettiers of each Divi≈øion clo≈øe to the right to order: the fir≈øt ≈øix files of Pikes in each grand Divi≈øion clo≈øe to the right to order, the re≈øt of the Pikes clo≈øe every five Files to the right, to the ≈øame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance; then there will be in each grand Divi≈øion four Divi≈øions of Pikes, and eight of Muskettiers, in manner as ≈øet forth to your view in Folio 147.</p>
                     <p>Before the Major ≈øhall begin his Exerci≈øe, he ≈øhall do well to appoint unto each Divi≈øion, the Captains and their En≈øigns, (who≈øe Colours in the mean time may be ≈øtuck in the ground, or given to any of the File-leaders of Pikes, to hold du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of Exerci≈øe) to take charge of them, to order them according unto every word of command, and the Lieutenant and Serjeants to each Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, that after ≈øilence is craved throughout the whole Regiment, the Major by ≈øtretching out his voice in every word of Command, the re≈øt as his Eccho are immediately to give it out along the whole Front, and from thence unto the Reer, and every Officer to lead his men accordingly.</p>
                     <p>The Major having ≈øtated all things according to the former directions, may if he plea≈øe, either face, double, counter-march, or wheel, to Front, Reer, or both Flanks in every particular Divi≈øion; And may after fire them by way of Divi≈øions
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108706:76"/>
drawn off ten or twenty paces before the Front, firing them 7 or 8 times over, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them by other ≈øupplies, marching up into their ground. And may after face the Reer-divi≈øions about, and fire them to Front and Reer on the ≈øame ground they ≈øtand, there being ≈øufficient intervalls for their wheeling off in the Reer of them≈øelves. And after ≈øeveral firings in this kinde, the Pikes may charge on; but before they begin their firings, the Pikes mu≈øt clo≈øe into the mid≈øt to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Muskettiers to clo≈øe their Pikes to open order, and every Divi≈øion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve ≈øo much ground betwixt each other for their conveniencie, that after firing they may wheel off.</p>
                     <p>Now if you will fire, or skirmi≈øh the one with the other, then draw off the Reer, or ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion, and move them away, and draw them up in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition 100 foot di≈øtance of ground betwixt each Front, and let the Lieutenant-Colonels Company be drawn up upon the right, and the Majors upon the left of that grand Divi≈øion, that it may carry ≈øome an≈øwerablene≈øs with that of the Colonels. The Muskettiers having ≈øix foot interval of ground betwixt each other before they begin to fire, they may continue their firings of this nature, as long as they plea≈øe, and the Pikes may after charge on to ≈øuch convenient di≈øtance, as that they come not within three Pikes length one of another, for avoiding doing hurt the one to the other, the Muskettiers ≈øtill continuing their firing, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Reer of them≈øelves; and when they come within di≈øtance, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent above knee-height, for the above-named rea≈øons. Now the Souldiers being almo≈øt tired, and all their Powder ≈øpent, and retreating from each other, that ≈øide which falls out to be ≈øtronge≈øt, (as being the Colonels grand Divi≈øion or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) may beat a parley, to invite the weaker to come in to mercy, offering them all fair Quarter, provided they timely and pre≈øently receive it, and that they will cheerfully and willingly go along with them, and never any more revolt, but be on their ≈øide, to fight with them upon all ju≈øt occa≈øions, as ≈øhall be required. After which, the Lieutenant-Colonel yeilding, they may wheel about, and march into the ≈øame ground from whence they were fir≈øt drawn forth, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the ≈øame order and condition as they were before they began to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øh. And thus much ≈øhall ≈øuffice concerning the ordinary plain way of exerci≈øing of Regiments: but tho≈øe that ≈øhall de≈øire a little more curio≈øity, they may ob≈øerve ≈øuch Exerci≈øes as in the next place ≈øhall be ≈øet forth unto them.</p>

                     <p>IT might be expected after Doublings, that I ≈øhould ≈øhew ≈øome kinds of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarches among≈øt the Military Motions, in the exerci≈øe of a Regiment; but being of very little u≈øe or practi≈øe among≈øt Commanders in the≈øe times, e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ≈øuch great Bodies; and for my own part, I fancy them not, therefore have pa≈ø≈øed them over, and pitcht upon ≈øuch wheelings, which by ≈øome are accounted Countermarches. Who≈øe judgements my de≈øire is better to inform by the≈øe ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rea≈øons following, wherein, and in what kind they differ from them. As thus: by the≈øe wheelings, they keep their di≈øtance in Rank and File unto Order, and wheeling entire unto any hand down to the Reer, cannot be performed but by gaining in the Motion before the Front, and unto all places as they move, ≈øo much ground as is the Length of their particular Divi≈øions; and in the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they ≈øtill pre≈øerve the honour of the right and left-hand-file-leaders, and all others as are concerned in their particular Divi≈øions, unto any accidental Front which they ≈øhall be brought unto. Now concerning Countermarches, they are to be performed either by ≈øingle Files, Ranks, Half-files, or Half-ranks, and at their di≈øtance of Open Order, their words of Command having relation to all the≈øe particulars. Their Countermarching of Files to the Reer gaineth no ground before the Front in the Motion, but only the room of one particular File upon the right; it pre≈øerveth not the honour of the right and left-hand-file-leader at one time by any one word of Command

unto any of their Motions to ≈øuch accidental Fronts they ≈øhall make, but ever lo≈øeth it to ≈øome, and giveth it to others. And therefore it may appear cleerly unto any ingenious capacity, that the former Wheelings cannot be accounted, or given in their Motions in that kinde to the Souldiers for Counter-marches, but by ≈øuch terms as in their place are ≈øet down. In the next place, I ≈øhall ≈øpeak ≈øomething of the great benefit or u≈øe that may be made of the≈øe ≈øorts of Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: as fir≈øt, a Commander may u≈øe them in the Motions of Doublings to Front, Reer, right-flank, or left, or double either the length or depth of the Battail unto all needful places, as occa≈øion ≈øhall require; which I ≈øhall forbear to ≈øet down, but leave them to the di≈øcretion of the ingenious Souldiers practi≈øe, when time and opportunity ≈øhall ≈øerve him to make u≈øe of them. In the next place, they are very nece≈ø≈øary to draw off any part, and to bring them unto ≈øuch need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful places for Service, as are in eminent danger.

                        <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> The manner of drawing up a Regiment, con≈øi≈øting of ≈øeven Companies, conteining in the four Captains, twelve Files of Muskettiers, and ≈øix of Pikes, in each of their particular Companies, and in the three Field-Officers, ≈øixteen Files apiece of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and eight of Pikes, which amounts to the number of <hi>864</hi> men.</head>
                     <p>IT hath been my ob≈øervation in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Suburbs thereof, there being eighteen Regiments, nine of the Trained Bands, and nine of the Auxiliaries, that their Regiments in ≈øome have but ≈øix Companies; others, and that for the mo≈øt part ≈øeven; and again in ≈øome, and but a few to have eight Companies. I ≈øhall therefore for the better ≈øatisfaction of ≈øuch as remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skill'd herein, go through them all, partly to ≈øhew the practi≈øe of this our City in their ≈øeveral drawings up, with the rea≈øons to confirm the ≈øame. And having pa≈ø≈øed over as much as is convenient, to ≈øatisfie any ingenious Souldier concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the drawing up of ≈øix Companies in a Regimental-way, with the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and rea≈øons of every particular Officer, as he there ≈øtands, it may in many things give full light to this that follows of ≈øeven Companies. Yet neverthele≈øs, for more fuller ≈øatisfaction herein, I ≈øhall ≈øhew the true manner hereof, that I may not be wanting to any Souldiers benefit that he ≈øhall receive thereby. Where note, for better Order herein, that I have pitcht upon a particular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, although it may many times fall out ≈øo, that the Captains Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and the Field-Officers cannot be ≈øo full as I have here ≈øet down. Or again, it may chance to fall out (as in our Trained Bands of <hi>London</hi>) that they be a great deal fuller, as ≈øometimes they are; for I have led a particular Company my ≈øelf upon a general day, being drawn into the Filed con≈øi≈øting of above 300 men. Yet neverthele≈øs, whether the Companies be great or ≈ømall, ob≈øerve this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule; make two grand Divi≈øions, and ballance their number equal in both Arms, and make no more Sub-divi≈øions then what you have Captains to lead, and Lieutenants to bring up; and let the Serjeants march by the Flanks, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108706:80"/>
not pre≈øume either to lead, or bring up any divi≈øions, being conceived by mo≈øt to be very improper. And again, if you fight the Regiment, let your Muskettiers as neer as you can be equal alike in their Sub-divi≈øions, as they may mo≈øt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently fall out, whether four, five, or ≈øix abre≈øt, it makes no great matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways leaving in time of fight, between ≈øuch numbers of Files, ≈øix foot of ground interval, for to wheel off their Ranks after they have fired.</p>
                     <p>Now, ≈øuppo≈øe the whole Regiment were marching to their general place of Randezvous; the Major being there beforehand, attending the Companies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, he Orders to the Colonels Company the mo≈øt convenient place for their drawing up; and next to him, the fourth Captains Company upon the left; and next to him, the third Captain; and after him, the elde≈øt or fir≈øt Captain, which makes the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion. In the next place, he orders the Lieutenant-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels Company to be on the left of the whole Regiment, ≈øtanding in even Front with the Colonel; upon the right of him, the ≈øecond Captain is placed, and after him the Majors own Company, which make up the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far proceeded, let the Major command the Pikes and Colours to advance forward ten paces, before the Front of Muskettiers; then let him clo≈øe the Pikes of the fir≈øt four Companies to the right to Order, and the Pikes of the la≈øt to the left to Order, and the like of the Muskettiers in the Reer to tho≈øe hands, to the ≈øame di≈øtance; then they will ≈øtand in four Divi≈øions; two of Pikes in the Front, and two of Muskettiers in the Reer. In the next place, let him count how many Files of Pikes there are in each Divi≈øion, and he will finde in the Colonels Divi≈øions 26 Files, and in the Lieutenant-Colonels but twenty two. To make the≈øe even, he mu≈øt take off one File apiece from the younge≈øt Captains, and bring them into the mid≈øt of the Lieutenant-Colonels Divi≈øion; and then he will make them equal, there being in each grand Divi≈øion 24 Files of Pikes. The Pikes being made thus equal, let him move down into the Reer, and examine the Muskettiers; where upon the right he will finde 52 Files, and upon the left but 44; to make the≈øe even in number, he mu≈øt take off one File apiece from the four Companies of the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion, and lead them away up into the mid≈øt of the ≈øecond; and then there will be in each grand Divi≈øion of Muskettiers 48 Files apiece. In the next place, let him face them to the right and left outward, and move them to ≈øuch convenient di≈øtance, as he may after divide his Muskettiers into four Divi≈øions to move up, and flank the Pikes.</p>
                     <p>This being performed, he ought appoint unto every Captain and Lieutenant his place where to lead, and where to bring up, and what men upon all occa≈øions they are to fight. To which purpo≈øe, there being in the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion four Captains, there mu≈øt be four places to lead, and four to bring up; and therefore having their four Colours upon the long March, that Body of Pikes may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two Divi≈øions, and to march with two Colours in the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Pikes, which are to be led by the elde≈øt Captain, and brought up by the Captain-Lieutenants Bringer-up. The ≈øecond Divi≈øion of Pikes is to be led by the fourth Captain, and to be brought up by the elde≈øt Captain-Lieutenant. The Reer-guard of Muskettiers in this grand Divi≈øion, is to be led by the third Captain, and to be brought up by his Lieutenant; who upon the long March, his Captain if he plea≈øeth, may exchange places, being more honour to him to be there to bring up, then to lead that Divi≈øion, as hath been formerly expre≈øt. As concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Captain-Lieutenant, his place is to be fixed according as in the Figure to lead the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, and to be brought up by the fourth Captains Lieutenant: but at ≈øuch time when they are drawn up all abre≈øt, they are to take their places as at fir≈øt fixed, both in their leading and bringing-up, as ≈øhall be ≈øet forth in the following Figure, with all their ≈øeveral places appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. As concerning all the re≈øt, they are placed in manner as was ≈øhewed in my di≈øcour≈øe of a Regiment con≈øi≈øting of ≈øix Companies.</p>
                     <p>But here it may be objected, that in the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion I have placed the Colonel, elde≈øt Captain, third and fourth, and by ca≈øting up their number of dignity, we finde it to amount unto 18; and in the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108706:80"/>
the Lieutenant-Colonel, Major and ≈øecond Captain, who≈øe number amounts but to ten. Here we finde (≈øay they) a great deal of difference and alteration, your intentions principally tending to make them equal in dignity; for certainly, where the greater number is, there is the le≈ø≈øer dignity; and therefore a wrong unto that part where ever it ≈øo falls out.</p>
                     <p>To which I an≈øwer, Where there is no ju≈øt exceptions to be made to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the former Rule ought ever to be pre≈øerved in the keeping an equal ballance of the number of dignity; but herein it doth not: For the Colonel ought always to have placed in his Divi≈øion the elde≈øt Captain, who is to lead his Colours, and the fir≈øt Body of Pikes, which is the fir≈øt place of honour among the Captains: And in the ≈øecond place, the Majors Company is always drawn up upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt part, on the right of the Lieutenant-Colonels grand Divi≈øion, to carry an equal proportion of number, they being the ≈øecond and third worth unto that of the fir≈øt or fourth, as is in the Colonels. In the next place, the ≈øecond Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains turn comes to be regarded, who by the ≈øame Rule, as the elde≈øt Captain layes claim to carry the fir≈øt honour, by leading the fir≈øt Body of Pikes, and the Colonels Colours; ≈øo the ≈øecond Captain cannot expect any other, but to be placed to lead the ≈øecond Body of Pikes, &amp; the Lieutenant-Colonels Colours. Now there being an odd Captain, he mu≈øt be either placed upon the right or left; he is therefore thought in di≈øcretion to be rather placed with the Colonel in his Divi≈øion, that his Colours may there flie, marching four together, being far more honourable and graceful then that of three, as in the Lieutenant-Colonels; and therefore where there is an honour in that kinde which cannot be divided, it is very fit and requi≈øite to place and fix it with him that is the Commander in chief. As for number of men, both Divi≈øions are equal alike; and therefore, I conceive, what hath been ≈øpoken may take off all objections of this nature.</p>
                     <p>And now according to my promi≈øe, I ≈øhall ≈øet forth the manner of the ≈øtanding of ≈øeven Companies in a Regimental way, with all the ≈øeveral places of honour appointed forth unto them, either marching, or ≈øtanding all even abre≈øt: If they be upon the long march, they are to ob≈øerve that manner ≈øet down in ≈øix Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, onely to minde that alteration before expre≈ø≈øed: the Figure of their draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and the Officers ≈øtated in their proper places, follows in Folio 156.</p>
                     <p>From which Figure I ≈øhall draw up another, placing the Souldiers in Battalia, which may be u≈øeful for them to fight-upon.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> The manner of drawing up and placing the Officers of a Regiment con≈øi≈øting of eight Companies, having in it a Colonel, a Lieutenant-Colonel, a Major, and five Captains: their number of men in each Company, being equal with the former Regiment, they amount unto <hi>972</hi> men.</head>
                     <p>IT concerns a Major (provided he have room enough) to draw up every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany even abre≈øt, and to give unto every Captain his due place of honour; after which, he may proceed to order them in a regimental way. Wherefore, briefly thus; ob≈øerve the manner of the Dignity of every Captain, how they ought to be placed, fir≈øt the Colonels Company being drawn up in its convenient place; next to him upon the left ≈øtands the third Captain; and next to him the fourth; and the next that follows is the elde≈øt: the≈øe four Captains being drawn up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, makes the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion; and therefore I ≈øhall endeavour to give Rea≈øons for to confirm this, before I ≈øhall proceed upon the ≈øecond, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right half-ranks, which ought to carry an equal proportion of Worth, Honour, and Dignity with that of the la≈øt. Where, fir≈øt, take notice, that the Colonel being the mo≈øt worthie≈øt man, is placed upon the right, and is the fir≈øt place of Honour; and the outmo≈øt upon the left is the elde≈øt Captain, which is the fourth Worth, there being the Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, and Major above him: now con≈øider that the fir≈øt and fourth Worth makes the number five; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the≈øe two is drawn up the third and fourth Captains, which are the ≈øixth and ≈øeventh Worth, who≈øe number carries 13; add them to that number above, and it makes 18. In the next place, ≈øince it is the judgement of mo≈øt Souldiers, that there ≈øhould be an equal proportion of Skill, Valour, and Worth, the Reer-half-files an≈øwerable to them of the Front: ≈øo likewi≈øe the ≈øame rule is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved between the right and left half-ranks; That whether we con≈øider the Front-divi≈øions, or Reer, right or left half-ranks, they may be ≈øo ballanced in every kind of re≈øpect, with true proportion; ≈øo neer as the knowledge of the Souldiers, and number of men will give leave. To which purpo≈øe, I will proceed to draw up the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion, and compare it to the fir≈øt; The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonels Company being drawn up upon the left of the whole Regiment; upon his right, is the ≈øecond Captain drawn up; and next to him the fifth Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; after, the Major upon the right of the Lieutenant-Colonels Divi≈øion. Now, if we con≈øider, the Lieutenant-Colonel he is the ≈øecond man of Honour, and therefore ought to be upon the outmo≈øt part of the Front on the left, when the Companies are marching all even abre≈øt; but upon the Long-march he is to fall down into the Reer; the outmo≈øt upon the right of his Divi≈øion is the Majors Company placed, and he is the third man of Honour. Now the third Worth and ≈øecond will carry equal ballance of number with that of the fir≈øt and fourth: and ≈øo have I ≈øet forth the four fir≈øt places of Honour, which, I ≈øuppo≈øe, no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souldier can deny. Betwixt the ≈øecond and third Worth is drawn up the ≈øecond Captain and fifth; the ≈øecond Captain is the fifth Worth, and the fifth Captain is the eighth, which makes the number 13, and will carry an equal weight of number with tho≈øe in the mid≈øt of the fir≈øt and fourth Worth. Now having ≈øtated the ≈øeveral Worths of the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion, being compared together, makes a like number of 18 unto that of the fir≈øt Divi≈øion. And to take off all Objections that might be made concerning the ≈øecond Captain and fifth, why they ≈øhould not rather be placed in the fir≈øt Divi≈øion, then in the ≈øecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it hath been held by the opinion of ≈øome, it ≈øhould be ≈øo, but never any ≈øub≈øtantial rea≈øon to be given for the ≈øame: Therefore, unto this I ≈øhall ≈øay, that they ought to be there where I have placed them, in re≈øpect of what I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ≈øaid, that as it is the fir≈øt place of Honour among≈øt the Captains to lead the fir≈øt Body of Pikes, where the Colonels Colours does flie, and to make them of the ≈øecond Divi≈øion equal in number with the fir≈øt; the younge≈øt Captain, which is the eighth Worth, is brought in, and joyned to the ≈øecond Captain, who is the fifth, and therefore a File or a Rank ought to be ≈øet forth in Dignity after this manner, in re≈øpect

there is no truer ≈øtating the Dignity of a ≈øingle File or Rank, then that which ≈øhall conform to greater Bodies, as that of Regiments. And thus much briefly ≈øhall ≈øuffice to be ≈øpoken concerning the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion, for the placing the ≈øecond and fifth Captains betwixt the Lieutenant-Colonel and the Majors, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect the ≈øecond Captain ≈øtands very aptly there to receive his proper place, and the younge≈øt Captain is brought in to ballance their Dignities unto that of the fir≈øt.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, I ≈øhall ≈øhew how they ought to be drawn up in a Regimental way: being all even abre≈øt as before, command Muskettiers to face about, and to march down 12 foot clear of the Reer, then face to the Front, after clo≈øe Files outward to Order of each Arms, then ≈øubdivide each Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, and move them up to flank each Body of Pikes. And having accounted and ca≈øt up the number of Files of each Arms in each grand Divi≈øion, you will finde the Colonels Divi≈øion to have in it 26 Files of Pikes, and 52 Files of Muskettiers; next the Lieutenant-Colonels Divi≈øion being examined, you will finde that to have in it 28 Files of Pikes, and 56 Files of Muskettiers. Now to make the≈øe equal in number, there mu≈øt be taken forth one File of Pikes, and two of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers from the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion, and place one a piece in the mid≈øt of the fir≈øt Divi≈øion, in every one of their particular Divi≈øions, and they will contain equal alike in each grand Divi≈øion 27 Files of Pikes, and 54 Files of Muskettiers. In the next place, the Major may a≈ø≈øign unto every Captain and Lieutenant where his place ≈øhall be to lead, and where to bring up; the Colonel being upon the head of his Divi≈øion, and the Lieutenant-Colonel upon the head of the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion, the Major in the Front betwixt them both, or where el≈øe he plea≈øeth, being an Officer always to act through the whole Regiment. And in the fir≈øt place he appoints the Captain-Lieutenant to be on the head of the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, and to be brought up with the fourth Captains Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; next he orders the elde≈øt Captain to be on the head of the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Pikes, and to be brought up by the Captain-Lieutenants Bringer-up; and the fourth Captain to be on the head of the ≈øecond divi≈øion of Pikes, and to be brought up by the elde≈øt Captains Lieutenant; and the ≈øecond divi≈øion of Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers he appoints unto the third Captain, and to be brought up by his own Lieutenant; and upon the Long-march, let him and his Captain change places until ≈øuch time they ≈øhall draw up again. After he orders his own Lieutenant to be on the head of the third divi≈øion of Muskettiers; and the third divi≈øion of Pikes he appoints to the fifth Captain, and to be brought up by his own Lieutenant; the fourth Divi≈øion of Pikes is ordered to be the ≈øecond Captains place, and brought up by his own Lieutenant; the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant is appointed to the fourth and la≈øt divi≈øion of Muskettiers, the Lieutenant-Colonel upon the Long-march bringing up the whole Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It might be ≈øuppo≈øed the Captain-Lieutenant, Lieutenant-Colonels and Majors Lieutenants have too great places of Honour: but to an≈øwer them all, their Captains being Field-Officers, and upon ≈øeveral occa≈øions moving off, their Lieutenants do officiate there in their rooms, and are but as a≈ø≈øi≈øtants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; for likewi≈øe upon ≈øeveral occa≈øions they come to tho≈øe places them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to lead, marching there before their Lieutenants. As concerning the placing of all the re≈øt of the other Officers, they lie clearly, for as much as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath been ≈øpoken in their proper places, without (as I conceive) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of any.</p>

                        </gap>on the Long-march the Colonel draws off the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, and leads them, marching ≈øome 12 foot before his Captain-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and that divi≈øion is brought up by the fourth Captains Lieutenant, the Colours marching two and two upon every divi≈øion, whereof the fir≈øt is drawn off and led by the fir≈øt Captain, and brought up by the Captain-Lieutenants Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-up; the next divi≈øion of Pikes falling in the Reer of the fir≈øt, and led by the fourth Captain, and brought upo the fir≈øt Captains Lieutenant; the ≈øecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion of Muskettiers is led by the: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108706:83"/>
his own Captain; the fourth or fir≈øt divi≈øion of Muskettiers in the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion is led by the Major, when he plea≈øeth, ≈øome 12 foot before his own Lieutenant; and the third Divi≈øion of Pikes is led by the fifth Captain, and brought up by his own Lieutenant; the fourth and la≈øt divi≈øion of Pikes is led by the ≈øecond Captain, and brought up by his own Lieutenant; the fourth and la≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers is led by the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieutenant, the Reer of the whole Regiment being brought up by the Lieutenant-Colonel. Thus every Divi≈øion is to march by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, the one in the Reer of another, keeping eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen foot di≈øtance betwixt every Divi≈øion, until they ≈øhall have room to march all even abre≈øt, and then with very little alteration with the third Captain, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging places, with his own Lieutenant, they are all to take their places again, as at fir≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Having now ≈øet forth the true Dignity of every Captains and Lieutenants place, what men they ≈øhall take charge on to fight, where to lead, and where to bring up; I ≈øhall ≈øpare the Figure in re≈øpect I ≈øhall ≈øhew (with very little alteration) the manner of drawing up and marching of divers Regiments that were under the command of the late Earl of <hi>E≈ø≈øex.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion in re≈øpect of every Officer and place, is to be ordered as the former; only in the ≈øecond, there will be this ≈ømall alteration, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Colonels Company and the Majors are to enterchange places, the re≈øt are to remain as they were, only with this alteration following; the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieutenant is to lead the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, until ≈øuch time that his Lieutenant Colonel ≈øhall come unto that place; and then he is to bring up that Divi≈øion being near at hand, that if his Lieutenant-Colonel ≈øhould upon ≈øome ju≈øt occa≈øions be called off, he may immediatly move up, and lead there in his ab≈øence. For upon the Long-march, as the Colonel leads the fir≈øt grand Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion, ≈øo it is conceived by ≈øome, (they marching in two grand Divi≈øions ≈øome twenty paces di≈øtance from each other in manner of two regimental Marchings) that the Lieutenant-Colonel ought to lead the ≈øecond. Next, let the Fir≈øt Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Pikes be led by the ≈øecond Captain, and to be brought up by the fifth Captains Lieutenant; and the ≈øecond Divi≈øion of Pikes to be led by the fifth Captain, and brought up by the ≈øecond Captains Lieutenant; the la≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers to be led by the Majors Lieutenant, and the Reer of the ≈øecond grant Divi≈øion being left for the Major to bring up, at ≈øuch time as with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency he may be ≈øpared. Therefore, to march thus, it being a very good way, and with very little alteration to be made, I was unwilling to pa≈øs it by, leaving it to the di≈øcretion of every ingenious Souldier, to make u≈øe of which way he be≈øt plea≈øeth, or likes of, while≈øt I in the next place ≈øhall ≈øet forth the Figure, which follows in <hi>pag.</hi> 161; affording more variety in the ≈øame.</p>

And after, if they ≈øhould be charged round, they may give fire over them again≈øt their enemies, and fall in the Reer of them≈øelves; yet neverthele≈øs, if the Hor≈øe ≈øhould be undaunted, and attempt to come on again, they may re≈øi≈øt them with a more de≈øperate charge after this manner, bringing all hands to fight, and to pour out their ≈øhot, or to fire altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after this kind. Command fir≈øt the Pikes to move forward, until they be three foot behind the Muskettiers, then let every File rank to the right, which will make them to ≈øtand but one abre≈øt in one ≈øingle <hi>Ring</hi> behind the Muskettiers. Now that all hands may be brought to fight together, command the fir≈øt Rank of Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers to kneel down, the ≈øecond ≈øtoop, and the third ≈øtand upright; then let all clo≈øe forward to clo≈øe Order, and let the Pikes, as occa≈øion ≈øhall require, charge betwixt the Muskettiers, who may fire altogether, and the Pikes may charge on while≈øt the Muskettiers make ready again. The Pallizadoes formerly ≈øtuck, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Hor≈øe from breaking in upon them, they may fire after this manner, as often as they plea≈øe. And ≈øo much may ≈øuffice to be ≈øpoken concerning the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and u≈øe that may be made of it in time of fight; and now in the next place I come to reduce them into Companies again as at fir≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Let the Pikes that ranked to the right, file three to the left as they were, and let the Bringers-up that doubled face about to the right, and march forth into their places. Then let the Major come to that place where he clo≈øed the <hi>Ring,</hi> and brake it off, wheeling them all along about to the left, until he hath brought them to ≈øtand in one even Front as at fir≈øt; the ≈øame in like manner to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Pikes, and to ≈øtand in the Reer of the Muskettiers. Next, let the Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers and Pikes face outward, and move to ≈øuch convenient di≈øtance, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Muskettiers may be ≈øubdivided again, and the Pikes move up, and double their Front inward entire in each grand Divi≈øion. Which being brought into that form, each Captain may draw off his men, being ≈øo commanded by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, and compleat up his Company again, and be after di≈øpo≈øed of to farther du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or to march home to their Quarters according to command.

                     <p>In the next place compare the Dignity of the right Half-ranks with the left, and they are ballanced as neer as can be po≈ø≈øible to be equal, there being one odd, which of nece≈ø≈øity mu≈øt be ca≈øt upon the right Half-ranks, for the rea≈øons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly expre≈øt, in placing the ≈øecond Captain into the Lieutenant-Colonels Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion. Then according to the former rule, draw forth the Pikes, and ingro≈øs them into two Bodies, and the like of the Muskettiers; after ≈øub-divide the Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and make them four divi≈øions, and move them up to flank the Pikes, and then they will be in two compleat grand Divi≈øions. In the next place, let the Major order forth unto the Captains and Lieutenants their ≈øeveral places to lead and to bring up, after this manner. There being two grand Divi≈øions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in them five Captains, and five Lieutenants, it will be nece≈ø≈øary to appoint our five ≈øeveral Charges in the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion to lead, and five to bring up, after this manner. As fir≈øt, divide the Van-guard into two Divi≈øions, the fir≈øt to be led by the Captain-Lieutenant, and brought up by his Bringer-up: the ≈øecond Divi≈øion of Muskettiers in the Van to be led by the third Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Lieutenant, and to be brought up by the fourth Captains Lieutenant. The fir≈øt divi≈øion of Pikes is to have the three fir≈øt Colours to fly upon the head of them, and to be led by the elde≈øt Captain, and brought up by the ≈øeventh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Lieutenant: the next divi≈øion of Pikes to be led by the fourth Captain, having his own and the elde≈øt Captains Colours flying upon the head of them, and to be brought up by the ≈øeventh, or younge≈øt Captain in the Regiment: the Reer-guard of Muskettiers of the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion to be led by the third Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and brought up by the elde≈øt Captains Lieutenant, who upon the Long-march the≈øe two are to inter-change places if the third Captain de≈øire it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ≈øuch permi≈ø≈øion from the Major, being more honour to bring up, then to lead, as was ≈øaid before in the former Regiments.</p>
                     <p>Next follows the placing of the Officers in the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion: let the Van-guard of Muskettiers there be led by the Majors Lieutenant, or by him≈øelf when he plea≈øeth, and be brought up by the fifth Captains Lieutenant: next let the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Pikes be led by the fifth Captain; having two Colours flying in the head of them, the Majors, and his own, and to be brought up by the ≈øixth Captains Lieutenant: let the next Divi≈øion of Pikes be led by the ≈øecond Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, having three Colours flying on the head of them, the Lieutenant-Colonels, his own, and the ≈øixth Captains, and let that be brought up by the ≈øecond Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Lieutenant: let the la≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers be led by the ≈øixth Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and brought up by the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieutenant; the Lieutenant-Colonel upon the Long-march bringing up the Reer of the Regiment, ≈øome 12 foot behind his own Lieutenant.</p>

                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:108706:86"/>I ≈øhall in the next place ≈øhew the Rea≈øons for the thus placing of the Officers, where fir≈øt I ≈øhall endeavour to clear the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion, which will occa≈øion the ≈øecond to be more ea≈øily re≈øolved. Where briefly thus, as concerning the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, elde≈øt Captain, third Captain, and Captain-Lieutenant, I ≈øhall pa≈øs them over, having formerly ≈øpoken ≈øufficient to ≈øatisfie any Souldier therein. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows therefore to ≈øpeak of the fourth Captains place, which is the next man of Honour after the former, and therefore is placed to lead the ≈øecond Divi≈øion of Pikes, which is more honour to him to lead there, then to lead a ≈øub-divi≈øion of Muskettiers. In the Van-guard next to him in Honour in this Divi≈øion, is the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Captain, who is appointed to bring up the fir≈øt grand Body of Pikes, which likewi≈øe is more Honour unto him, then to lead or bring up any ≈øub-divi≈øion of Muskettiers; as before expre≈ø≈øed. Having thus re≈øolved of all the Captains, and Captain-Lieutenants place, next follows the rea≈øons of the Lieutenants places; where fir≈øt take notice that the elde≈øt Captains Lieutenant is appointed to bring up the Reer-guard, which next the Pikes is the greate≈øt place of honor in the reer, and a very honorable place unto him; or if he alters places with the third Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon the Long-march, yet neverthele≈øs he hath the chiefe≈øt place of honour after the Capt. Lieut. among≈øt all the Lieutenants unto tho≈øe places he is ordered unto. The third Captains Lieutenant is a≈ø≈øigned to the next place, who leads the ≈øecond Divi≈øion of Muskettiers in the Van-guard, which is more honour to him then to bring up any ≈øuch Divi≈øion; after follows him the fourth Captains Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, who brings up the Reer of the Van-guard, which is more honour to him, of the places remaining, to be there, then to bring up either the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, or the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Pikes. La≈øtly, the ≈øeventh Captains Lieutenant is placed to bring up the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Pikes, which being the more honourable Arms, it adds more honour to him to be there to bring up, then the fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, which being the la≈øt place of honour, it is given to the Captain-Lieutenants Bringer-up to be there. And thus much ≈øhall ≈øuffice for the rea≈øons of the places of the fir≈øt grand Divi≈øion.</p>
                     <p>Now for placing of the Officers of the ≈øecond grand Divi≈øion, I ≈øhall not need to ≈øpeak any thing concerning the Lieutenant-Colonels Major, Second Captain, and the Majors Lieutenants place, in regard in the former Regiments I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to give the Souldier ≈øatisfaction therein. Therefore next to tho≈øe in this grand Divi≈øion follows to be ≈øpoken is the fifth Captain, who is the next man of honour, and therefore hath his due place appointed out to him to lead the fir≈øt divi≈øion of Pikes, where the Majors and his own <hi>Colours</hi> flie, which is more honour to him to lead there the Van of the Pikes, then the Reer-guard of Muskettiers. Next to him is the ≈øixth Captain, which next the Pikes hath his due place of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour remaining to him to lead the Reer-guard. Having thus re≈øolved the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains places, I ≈øhall in the next endeavour to ≈øhew the Lieutenants, where fir≈øt it falls to the Lieut. Colonels Lieutenant to be placed fir≈øt, who is ordered to bring up the Reer, to be an a≈ø≈øi≈øtant unto his Lieut. Colonel, who is a Field-Officer, and may have many occa≈øions to fall off, and therefore he requires his Lieutenant to be pre≈øent with his men there, as the Colonels doth his in the Front. And as much may be ≈øaid of the Majors Lieutenant, but pa≈ø≈øing him by, I come next to the ≈øecond Captains Lieutenant, who is appointed to bring up the Reer of the ≈øecond Body of Pikes, which is the greate≈øt place of honour that is in the Reer next to the Lieu. Colonels Lieutenant. After him follows the fifth Captains Lieutenant, who is placed to bring up the Reer of the Van-guard of this divi≈øion, which is more honor then to bring up the Van of the Pikes, who≈øe turn being the la≈øt place of honor, fals to him that is the younge≈øt Lieutenant, which is the ≈øixth Captains Lieutenant.:</p>
                     <p>And thus as briefly as I could I have run over all the rea≈øons for the placing of the Officers in the Regiment drawn up after this manner, that I might not be wanting unto the de≈øire of any ≈øuch who are willing to be informed therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always ready to employ my ≈øelf in as plain a way as I can for the benefit of all true loving Souldiers, who are concerned herein. And therefore, for their better ≈øatisfaction, let them ca≈øt their eye upon the Figure, as it is demon≈øtrated between <hi>Folio</hi> 161 and 162, where they ≈øhall ≈øee every man placed according to my former Di≈øcour≈øe.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe fir≈øt order of drawing up the Regiment at their fir≈øt place of Rande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, before they marched or joyn'd with the Army, was thus: The Colonels Company being upon the out-mo≈øt part of the right of the Regiment; next to his left by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion was drawn up the ≈øecond, ≈øixth, fifth, and fir≈øt Captain, which make up his Divi≈øion, or the right Half-ranks in their fir≈øt drawing up to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and may in their Figure of Dignity ≈øtanding in a rank be demon≈øtrated as followeth, 4:8:9:5:1: This number of Worth being ca≈øt up, amounteth to 27. And thus much for the Colonels Divi≈øion.</p>
                     <p>Now for the left Half-ranks, or Lieutenant-Colonels Divi≈øion, (as many times it is ≈øo ordred and appointed) his own Company being drawn up upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt part on the left of the Regiment; and next to his right after each other is drawn up the third, ≈øeventh, fourth, and Majors Company; who≈øe Figure of Dignity ≈øtanding Rank-wi≈øe, may be thus de≈øcribed, 2:6:10:7:3: and their number of Dignity in all amounteth to 28. Where you may perceive a rule that the Di≈øcretion of the Major walketh by, in the drawing up of the Regiment, to ballance with as neer proportion as he can the Number, Worth, and Dignity of his right Half-ranks, or right Flank, ≈øutable with that of the left. For it would be unrea≈øonable that all the be≈øt men ≈øhould be on the right, and that the left of the Regiment who are to oppo≈øe the Enemies right ≈øhould have the weake≈øt or meane≈øt men of Worth: therefore without all que≈øtion, that Body of men that ≈øhall be drawn up ≈øo as to make all parts of equal Worth, and Strength, as the right Flank with the left, the Front with the Reer, ≈øo that where-ever the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ≈øhall fall on to charge any one of the≈øe parts, being all made equal in Strength, and Worth, it mu≈øt needs prevent all murmuring complaints, and carry be≈øt approbation to all knowing Commanders. And thus much briefly may be ≈øpoken in the commendation of the ordring of his Regiment thus far.</p>
                     <p>The Captains now ≈øtanding by their own Colours, on the head of the Pikes, and their Companies being drawn up all, and ≈øtanding in an even Front, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor next commands the Muskettiers to ≈øtand, the Pikes and Colours to troop forth ≈øome ten or twelve paces cleer of the Muskettiers, and then they likewi≈øe to ≈øtand, and after to clo≈øe their Files to the mid≈øt to order.</p>
                     <p>Next he commands the Muskettiers in their Files to clo≈øe outward to order, commanding them afterward to move up, and flank the Pikes, after which he orders the Body into thirteen remarkable Divi≈øions, four Divi≈øions of Muskettiers upon each ≈øide of the Pikes, and the Pikes into five divi≈øions, having their Colours fly by two and two, and to be led by the En≈øign-bearers that do belong to each of them, excepting the fir≈øt and middle divi≈øions, for they have Leaders in chief, as the fir≈øt and fifth Captain, and the third Captain, to bring up the Reer of the whole Body of Pikes. For more fuller illu≈øtration of the leading and bringing up of each divi≈øion in the Regiment upon their Long-march, ob≈øerve the≈øe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The Regiment being upon their march, the fir≈øt divi≈øion upon the right is led by the Colonel, his Captain-Lieutenant marching in the Reer of him ≈øeveral paces, and that particular divi≈øion is brought up by the Captains-Lieutenants Bringer-up.</p>

                     <p>Here you may perceive they follow a rule to Ballance their number of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as neer as they can, carrying their odd number on the left Half-rank, and not upon the right; for the≈øe rea≈øons, as, I conceive, following. Their Regiments being ≈øo full of men, they draw them up for the mo≈øt part into three Squadrons,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108706:90"/>
or grand divi≈øions, giving unto the Lieutenant-Colonel the right Wing; the Major, the left; and the Colonel, the Main-battail. The Colonels grand Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion con≈øi≈øts of the four middle Companies, where you are to take notice, being drawn off ≈øome ten paces cleer from the re≈øt they ≈øtand after this manner by way of Figure, 4:7:9:1. The Lieutenant-Colonels Divi≈øion after this manner, 5:10:2. and the Majors after this kinde, 6:8:3. Wherein I do ob≈øerve in each grand Divi≈øion this Rule, that by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion and degrees they put the be≈øt Souldiers upon the right, and the ≈øecond according to cour≈øe upon the left, and the re≈øt between them. As fir≈øt, the Colonel being the chiefe≈øt man of honour, is placed upon the right of his Squadron; next to his left is the ≈øixth and fourth Captain, and the clo≈øing up of his grand Divi≈øion is placed the fir≈øt or elde≈øt Captain. The Lieutenant-Colonel being the ≈øecond man of honour, is likewi≈øe placed upon the right of his Squadron; and next to his left, the ≈øeventh Captain, his grand Divi≈øion being clo≈øed up by the ≈øecond Captain. In the next place, the Major, he being the third man of honour, is placed upon the right of his Squadron; and upon hisleft, the fifth Captain; and his grand Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion is clo≈øed up upon the left by the third Captain. So that you may ob≈øerve in the clo≈øing up of every Divi≈øion, that as every Field-Officer is upon the right of their Squadrons, ≈øo they take by degrees upon the outmo≈øt of their left to clo≈øe their Divi≈øions, the Captains according to their degrees by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion. As fir≈øt, and more cleerly, the Colonel takes the elde≈øt Captain to him on his left, who will aptly fall in to lead his Body of Pikes and Colours; the Lieutenant-Colonel takes the ≈øecond Captain for to lead his Stand of Pikes and Colours; the third Captain being placed upon the left of the outmo≈øt part of the Majors Squadron, to lead likewi≈øe his Colours and Body of Pikes. And further, if you ob≈øerve the number of worth and dignity, that the right Wing hath with the left, you will finde them to be equally ballanced, and to be ≈øeventeen alike in number. Now in re≈øpect there cannot be an equal Divi≈øion of the Colours by threes, there is very good rea≈øon that the odd ≈øhould be placed in the Colonels Squadron, who is Commander in chief, and to whom it properly belongs unto.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, I ≈øhall ≈øhew you how to draw them forth in a Regimental-way; the four middle Companies being advanced forward ten paces cleer form the three outmo≈øt Companies, may ≈øtand; then draw forth the Pikes of each Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, until they be ten foot cleer of their Muskettiers; then clo≈øe Pikes into the mid≈øt to Order in their Files in each Divi≈øion, and they will be in three Bodies; after clo≈øe the Muskettiers into the mid≈øt to Order, then ≈øub-divide them in as equal a way as you can; and let them move up upon the right and left, and flank each Body of Pikes. Then let the Major examine the Files in the Colonels Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion, how many they exceed in number the other two, and he will finde twelve Files of Muskettiers, and ≈øix Files of Pikes, more then in the re≈øt. Now to make them equal alike in each Squadron, let him take off from each particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Colonels Squadron, one File of Pikes, and place two of tho≈øe four in the mid≈øt of the Lieutenant-Colonels Squadron, and the remaining two in the mid≈øt of his own Squadron; which being done, each body of Pikes will have in it 22 Files. After let him take off from each Company two Files of Muskettiers, which will be eight Files, &amp; let him place two Files in the mid≈øt of each Flank of Muskettiers, both in the Divi≈øions of the Lieutenant-Colonels and his own; and then there will be in each particular Divi≈øion of Muskettiers 21 Files. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewi≈øe a very good way to draw up a Regiment of ≈øo great a number of men, I was unwilling to pa≈øs it by, but to pre≈øent it unto the view of all loving Souldiers, which will more fuller appear in the Figure following (Folio 167) in which Figure I ≈øhall ≈øhew the ≈øeveral places of the Captains, and their Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, where they are to lead, and where to bring up.</p>

                     <p>Having thus far proceeded, he may command the four outmo≈øt Companies upon each Flank, to advance forward ≈øome ten paces cleer from the four middle Companies; then let them ≈øtand, and after let him draw forward the Pikes cleer from the Muskettiers, and clo≈øe their Files outward to Order; then let the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108706:92"/>
Muskettiers be divided into four parts, their Files being clo≈øed to Order, let them move forward, and flank tho≈øe two Bodies of Pikes. After in the ≈øame manner move forward the Pikes in the four middle Companies, until they be cleer of the Muskettiers, and clo≈øe their Files into the mid≈øt to Order, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their Muskettiers into two parts, and let them move forward, and flank the Body of Pikes; and then they will ≈øtand in their Squadrons or grand Divi≈øions, their dignities ≈øtanding after this manner in the Colonels divi≈øion, thus, 4:9:12:1. In the Lieutenant-Colonels divi≈øion, thus, 5:8:11:2. and in the the Majors, thus, 6:7:10:3. So that you may perceive this to be a very good way among≈øt the re≈øt, each particular Squadron bearing the number of 26, and having unto every one of them their Dignities and worths equally divided, and ≈øtated alike. In the next place, the Major ought to inquire of the number of men they carry in each divi≈øion of both Arms; where as fir≈øt, he ≈øhall finde in the Colonels Squadron, to have in it 26 Files of Pikes, and 52 Files of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; and examining all the re≈øt, they will fall out to the ≈øame proportion of number. So that in each Divi≈øion there contains, whether they be Pikes, or Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers, to have in every particular thereof 78 Files. In the next place, he ≈øhall do well to appoint forth unto them their ≈øeveral places to lead and bring up; and fir≈øt, of the Colonels grand Divi≈øion, he being on the head thereof, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Lieutenant leading the fir≈øt divi≈øion of Muskettiers in his Squadron, being brought up by his Bringer-up; the fir≈øt two Colours, and his half Body of Pikes to be led by the elde≈øt Captain, and brought up by the ninth Captains Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the next two Colours, and half Body of Pikes to be led by the ninth Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and brought up by the elde≈øt Captains Lieutenant; the la≈øt divi≈øion of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers in his Squadron, to be led by the ≈øixth Captain, and brought up by his own Lieutenant. The fir≈øt divi≈øion of Muskettiers in the Lieutenant-colonels Squadron, is led by his own Lieutenant, and brought up by the eighth Captains Lieutenant; his fir≈øt two Colours, and half Body of Pikes is led by the ≈øeventh Captain; and the next two Colours, and half Body of Pikes, is led by the eigthth Captain, and brought up by the ≈øecond Captains Lieutenant; his la≈øt divi≈øion of Muskettiers is led by the fifth Captain, and brought up by his own Lieutenant; him≈øelf ≈øtanding as the Colonel doth upon the head of his Squadron. The fir≈øt divi≈øion of Muskettiers in the Majors Squadron (him≈øelf being upon the head) is led by his own Lieutenant, and brought up by the ≈øeventh Captains Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; his fir≈øt two Colours, and half Body of Pikes is led by the third Captain; and the next two Colours, and half Body of Pikes, is led by the ≈øeventh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and brought up by the third Captains Lieutenant; his la≈øt divi≈øion of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers is led by the fourth Captain, and brought up by his Lieutenant; as in the next place, in the Figure ≈øet forth in Folio 170, more fully appeareth.</p>
                     <p>They ≈øtanding according to the former directions in three Bodies of Pikes flanked with the Muskettiers, before they come to the Figure ≈øet forth, you mu≈øt command in each grand divi≈øion the ≈øix inmo≈øt Files of Muskettiers next the Pikes to face about, and to march ≈øix paces cleer of the Reer, and then clo≈øe inward to Order. Afterward open every four Files outward to open Order, of tho≈øe 12 Files, and let the middle-divi≈øion there face about, and move down ≈øix foot cleer of the Reer; and after face to their Leader. Then there will remain 20 Files of Muskettiers upon the Flanks of each Body of Pikes; after move for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the eight middle Files of particular divi≈øion of Muskettiers, ≈øome ten foot before the Front. Then command the left-half-ranks, or the four Files of Muskettiers upon the left of tho≈øe divi≈øions drawn forth, to face about, and to move down ten foot cleer of the Reer, and after face to the Front. Then let the 12 remaining Files of Muskettiers clo≈øe to the Pikes to open Order; and let every four Files of tho≈øe remaining 12 upon the Flanks, open outward ≈øix foot of ground betwixt each four Files, and move the Front and Reer-divi≈øions of Muskettiers ju≈øt again≈øt the mid≈øt of tho≈øe three divi≈øions of Muskettiers that are the Flankers to the Pikes, and they will ≈øtand in the Figure as it is placed in Folio 170.</p>

Hexam,</hi> in his Book treating of the Office of the three Serjeant-Majors of the Tertia, otherwi≈øe called the three Field-Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. His words are the≈øe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The States Army by order of his Highne≈øs, is divided upon a March into three Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades or Tertia's; and a Serjeant-Major of a Tertia, being one of the great Captains of the Field, receives his Order immediate from the Lord-General, or the Lord Martial, but mo≈øt commonly of the Serjeant-Major-General of the Army, how he ≈øhall form and order his Brigade or Tertia; and how many Regiments of Hor≈øe and Foot are to march under it, and with what Ordnance and Baggage. He a≈ø≈øigns and ≈øhews him the place where they are to draw out into Battalia, and receives Orders from the Serjeant-Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, whether they are to march in the Van-guard, the Battail, or the Reer: So that in marching in every one of the≈øe, he ≈øhall attend upon his Brigade and ≈øeveral Divi≈øions; and in the ab≈øence of the Serjeant-Major-General, ≈øee that the order of marching and embattailing be duly kept and ob≈øerved. And every one of the≈øe three Serjeants-Majors of Brigades, are to be at the command of the Colonel, General, or be that leads or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that Brigade or Tertia; and is to be ≈øent to the Lord-General, Lord-Martial, or Serjeant-Major-General upon any occa≈øion belonging to the ≈øervice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The≈øe three Majors of the Tertia's are to be lodged as neer the Serjeant-Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as conveniently may be; and tho≈øe three which attend upon the Van-guard, the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail or Reer, which the Serjeant-Major ≈øhall make choice of ground for the placing of Guards, and a≈ø≈øign them to the Serjeant-Majors of every Regiment. They are to go the Round, and to vi≈øit the Guard commonly every night, and at ≈øuch an hour as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant-Major ≈øhall appoint them either by day or night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If any of the≈øe three Serjeant-Majors of the Field ≈øhall finde any want of Powder, Ammunition or Victuals, either in the Van-guard, Battail or Reer, as well upon the march, as when the Troops are quartered, or during fight, he is pre≈øently to adverti≈øe the Serjeant-Major-General of the Field with the ≈øaid wants. And then by his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ≈øhall go with an Officer of every Regiment of that Tertia, to the General, or Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Ordnance, or to the Commi≈ø≈øary General of the Ammunition, or Victuals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Serjeant-Major of a Tertia, to conclude, having received his Orders from the Lord-General, the Martial, or Serjeant-Major-general, gives them to the Serjeant-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors of every particular Regiment. But becau≈øe the Word and Orders are to be ≈øent to Quarters far di≈øtant one from another, the Serjeant-Major of every Regiment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:108706:95"/>
come conveniently to the Serjeant-Major-General. Therefore the Majors of every Brigade are to attend every morning and evening upon the Serjeant-Major-General, to receive their Orders, and to carry the Word to the ≈øeveral Quarters, whither the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant-Majors of Regiments comes to him, and from him receives the Word and Orders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The drawing up of Brigades in the next place comes to be handled after the way of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> therefore, fir≈øt take notice, that Brigades are not tyed to a ≈øet number of Companies or Regiments, but are ordered according to the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ≈øtrengths of an Army. As ≈øometimes they con≈øi≈øt of 12 Companies, ≈øome of two Regiments, others of three, or four, having in them not alike number of Companies or men, which ought accordingly unto the ≈øeveral Divi≈øions of a Brigade to be ballanced alike, both in number of men, dignity, and worth, as is in particular Regiments fully ≈øet forth. And in re≈øpect that ≈øeveral Divi≈øions make a Brigade, and that according to the di≈øpo≈øition of an Army, all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers are divided into three parts, called Brigades or Tertia's, each of them having a ≈øeveral name; to wit, the Van-guard, Battail and Reer-guard. Now that Tertia which is to march fir≈øt, is called the Van-guard; that which marcheth next in the middle, the Battail; and that which comes up la≈øt, the Reer. Every one of the≈øe upon march, as was formerly expre≈ø≈øed in the Swedi≈øh Brigade, take their turns interchangeably; for the ≈øecond day of the March, the Battail becomes the Van-guard; and the Reer, the ≈øecond day the Battail; and the third day, the Tertia, that had fir≈øt the Reer, is become the Van-guard. So likewi≈øe, there ought to be in every particular Brigade or Tertia, a Van-guard, Battail and Reer-guard, to each of them; which with more conveniencie may be orderly brought to fight by him that ≈øhall be Commander in chief, for the relieving each other, according as occa≈øion ≈øhall require.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, for a Brigade, I ≈øhall point forth four Regiments, having in them eight Companies a piece, after the manner of a Regiment of eight former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øet down, which amounts to 3888 men, which number may ≈øerve for a third part of an Army of foot, and make up a very compleat and ≈øufficient Brigade. And I ≈øhall order in this Brigade to have in it four Divi≈øions; that is to ≈øay, a Van-guard, Battail and Reer-guard, repre≈øented in the three fir≈øt Regiments; but the fourth ≈øhall be a re≈øerve, ≈øtanding in the Reer of the Main-battail or Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, whereby upon all occa≈øions of the other retreating, or being driven back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that Regiment may move up to relieve each part thereof that ≈øhall be di≈øtre≈ø≈øed. But upon the Long-march of this Brigade, the two middle Regiments according to their order of dignity, are to make the Battail, which in the Figure were made the Van-guard, and Reer-guard; and that which formerly was the Van-guard, is become the Battail; and the Reer-guard, the Re≈øerve; but where they have ground ≈øufficient, it will be better to march in that form of Battalia, ≈øet down according to the Figure, Folio 176.</p>
                     <p>This Brigade con≈øi≈øting of four Regiments, mu≈øt be drawn up according to the dignity of their Captains; but with this alteration of Arms, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Regiments con≈øi≈øting of two Divi≈øions, this hath but one, after this manner:</p>

full of action, and therefore ought to be a wi≈øe, grave, and able per≈øon, and an experienced Souldier, in re≈øpect he hath the ordering and di≈øpo≈øing of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions and Battalions, according to that form which the General ≈øhall command him. And upon all occa≈øions he mu≈øt be active, and ≈øtirring up and down to ≈øpie out all advantages which might offend an Enemy; and wi≈øely to fore≈øee all di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages that may bring the Troops into any di≈øorder or confu≈øion. He hath ab≈øolute command over the three Serjeant-Majors of the <hi>Brigades,</hi> otherwi≈øe called the three <hi>Grand Corporals</hi> of the Field, who are to be his a≈ø≈øi≈øtants, and his mouth, as he is the mouth of the Lord General, or Martial of the Field; and therefore mu≈øt have a vigilant eye over all things, ≈øeeing that the Generals com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand delivered to him be ≈øtrictly kept and ob≈øerved; and withall acquainting and informing the three Serjeant-Majors of the <hi>Brigades</hi> of the Generals plea≈øure, that they may forthwith put the ≈øame into execution.</p>
                     <p>Now the Method (that I ≈øhall ob≈øerve) ≈øhall be according to the form of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Brigade;</hi> wherefore in the fir≈øt place, the Serjeant-Major ≈øhall do well to appoint out unto the elde≈øt Serjeant-Major of the <hi>Brigades,</hi> how to draw up that <hi>Brigade</hi> which ≈øhall be the Battail, wherein the Lord Generals Regiment, and the Colonels is to be upon the right and left of that <hi>Brigade,</hi> and betwixt them the elde≈øt Colonel, and ninth Colonel, according to this rule of Dignity in the Figure ≈øet forth, 4:9:12:1. In the next place, let the next Serjeant-Major of the <hi>Brigades</hi> in ≈øeniority draw up that which ≈øhall be the Van-guard, and place the ≈øecond Colonels Regiment upon the right, and the fifth upon the left, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them the eleventh and eighth Colonels, after this manner of this Figure, 5:8:11:2. Let the la≈øt Serjeant-Major draw up that <hi>Brigade</hi> which ≈øhall be in the Reer, and let him draw them up after this manner; the third Colonels Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment upon the right; and upon the left the ≈øixth Colonels; and between them the tenth and ≈øeventh Colonels Regiment after this manner, 6:7:10:3: This charge being given by the Serjeant-Major-General unto the three Serjeant-Majors of the three <hi>Tertias</hi> or <hi>Brigades,</hi> how each particular Regiment ≈øhall be drawn up, being every one ≈øingle, and compared alike each to other, being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øtated according to the rule of Dignity, avoiding thereby confu≈øion and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.

                     <p>After this, the General of the Ordnance, his duty and care mu≈øt be in the day of Battail, to ≈øee that the Ordnance be well placed; for at ≈øuch time his wi≈ødom is mo≈øt di≈øcern'd, keeping (with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of his Lieutenant) the Train of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery together in good order. He mu≈øt have a vigilant eye upon all accidents that may fall but, and make choi≈øe of ≈øuch ground for their planting, as the General of the Army and he ≈øhall think mo≈øt fit and convenient. He mu≈øt be careful that all things be in a readine≈øs, putting the Ma≈øter, Gunners, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Ordnance, and Commanders in minde of their duty, that they do their be≈øt endeavours, and acquit them≈øelves like men. It is likewi≈øe partly his charge to ≈øee that the whole Army be well provided with Ammunition, becau≈øe the Ammunition marcheth under his Train. He mu≈øt al≈øo be neer the General of the Army upon all occa≈øions, to receive his Directions and Commands, and to know from him after what manner he will make his Battail, that he may plant his Ordnance accordingly, finding out Hills and Heights to play over his own men. And when the Enemy ≈øhall pre≈øent him≈øelf, and come up to charge, he mu≈øt draw, and plant his Ordnance as neer their Hor≈øe as po≈ø≈øible may be, to hinder them from breaking in upon the Divi≈øions of Foot, taking along with him Saylours, and Pioneers, to help to draw up the Ordnance, and ≈øufficient Guards to defend them.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the planting of the Ordnance, when the Battalia is drawn up, they may be di≈øpo≈øed of ≈øeveral ways; as ≈øometimes they are placed upon the head of the Battalia; others again between them, by two and two; and others threes, upon the Flanks and Wings of the Muskettiers. Some are of opinion, that they ought to be planted upon the Flank, and in the Reer of the Battalia, by leaving a free place for Arms which may give no offence to their own men. But as concerning this la≈øt way, it might be an≈øwered, it can no way be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; for if an Enemy ≈øhould perceive that the Frout is left bare without Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it will give them cau≈øe to come up with more courage to fall on upon the Charge. Therefore, the be≈øt way among≈øt the ancient experienc'd Souldiers, is, that the Artillery be divided, ≈øome here, ≈øome there, both before the Front, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Battalions, and upon the Flanks, and to be placed ≈øome 50 or an 100 paces one from another; and then there will be no danger when the Enemy ≈øhall come up to ≈øhock to encounter you, or to offend our own men: E≈øpecially, when they are fa≈øtned to them by drawing Ropes and Iron Rings, that upon an in≈øtant they may be removed, and turn'd for the advantage of our own Troops, giving fire as fa≈øt as they can charge and di≈øcharge again≈øt the Enemies Troops, it being a matter of great moment for the obtaining of a Victory, and gaining the day from the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>But that many times the Ordnance cannot be planted in ≈øuch convenient places as could be wi≈øhed for, in re≈øpect an Army may be driven into ≈øuch places, as the Ordnance mu≈øt be planted according to the be≈øt ground it will afford, by rea≈øon of Woods, Hills, or Mari≈øh-grounds; and ≈øuch like di≈øadvantageous places, may be oftentimes met withal; for which no certain Rule may be given, but that the General by his wi≈ødom and di≈øcretion may make choice of the be≈øt advantages, which might annoy an Enemy mo≈øt, and give the lea≈øt offence to his own men, either by dazling them by the Sun, or by rai≈øing of the du≈øt, ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the winde which drives the Smoak both of the Ordnance and Small-≈øhot full upon them. To conclude, it is conceived the be≈øt way for every Captain of the Ordnance, and Ma≈øter-Gunner, to u≈øe ≈øome light Field-peeces and ≈ømall Drakes, which upon any occa≈øion may be removed from one place to another, being with ea≈øe planted upon ≈øuch places of advantage, as may mo≈øt annoy the Enemy.</p>

foot, which ought to be equally divided in their Troops, and placed upon the Flanks of the foot in ≈øuch good order, as the Troops may come with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie to fight, for the relieving of each other. But in ca≈øe you ≈øhall perceive the Enemies Hor≈øe, as ≈øometimes through nece≈ø≈øity of ground, or by other politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ends, may be interlaced and placed between the Intervals and Divi≈øions of their foot; it will be needful then that we ≈øhould ob≈øerve the ≈øame form, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe have Hor≈øe to come forth, and encounter with their Hor≈øe, le≈øt they ≈øhould break in upon our Divi≈øions of Foot; which by this means and good order, may be timely prevented.

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> The ≈øeveral duties belonging to the Foot in a Regiment, as followeth by degrees from a private Souldier unto a Colonel of the ≈øame: and fir≈øt, of a Private Souldier.</head>
                     <p>A Private Souldier ought to be very active, not ≈ølothful and idle, informing him≈øelf of his duty, learning from his Corporal, or other Officers, the true u≈øe and well handling of his Arms, always keeping them neat, clean, and well fixed. Upon the beat of the Drum, he is to repair to his Colours, Squadron; or Company; upon the march, he mu≈øt ob≈øerve his Leader, and his right and left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand-men, that he may march ≈øtreight in file, and even in rank; in time of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe he mu≈øt be ≈øilent in the Body, well minding the words of Command and Directions, which are given forth by the Leader. He ought likewi≈øe to be well vers'd in all the ordinary words of Command; and to mind the place wherein he ≈øtands, that he may the more readier move, and not be to ≈øeek at ≈øuch time when he ≈øhall be commanded, whether it be to face, double, counter-march, or wheel. He mu≈øt inform him≈øelf of all the ≈øeveral beats of the Drum; as fir≈øt, or a Call; ≈øecond, a Troop; third, a March; fourth, a Preparative; fifth, a Battle or Charge; ≈øixth, a Retreat, and al≈øo of the Revalley and the Tattoo.</p>
                     <p>By the fir≈øt, he is ≈øummoned to hear pre≈øent Proclamation, or el≈øe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repair to his Colours; upon the beat of the ≈øecond, he is to advance his Arms, and to clo≈øe in Rank and File, to the di≈øtance of Order, and to Troop along un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ≈øuch places and ≈øervices, as he ≈øhall be commanded unto; upon the hearing of the third, he is pre≈øently to ≈øhoulder his Arms, and to take his di≈øtance of ≈øix foot in Rank, and three foot in File; upon the fourth, he is to clo≈øe both in Rank and File, unto the fighting di≈øtance, which is called Order, and to prepare him≈øelf for skirmi≈øh; upon the beat of the next, he is undauntedly to move forward, boldly ≈øtepping in good Order, into the place of his fellow-Souldier that ≈øhall happen to fall down dead before him; upon the beat of the la≈øt, he mu≈øt orderly fall back, either for relief or advantage of ground, or other political ends whereby he may draw the Enemy into a ≈ønare. The fir≈øt of the remaining two, gives warning in the morning for ≈øome of the Sentinels to fall off, or to be taken in; the latter is u≈øed in the night to give notice unto the Souldiers, or others, for their repairing to their ≈øeveral Guards, Watches, and Lodgings. To conclude, a private Souldier ought to avoid all Quarrelling, Mutinies, Swearing, Cur≈øing or Lying, and to be content with his wages; and likewi≈øe to be a good Husband in the well managing of his means, keeping him≈øelf neat and hand≈øome in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; avoiding drunkenne≈øs, and all manner of gaming; truely to ≈øerve and fear God, and to be obedient unto all the commands of his ≈øuperiours, cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going on upon all Duties, and to be loving, kind, and courteous unto all his fellow-Souldiers.</p>

                        <head>The duty of a Sentinel.</head>
                        <p>A Sentinel mu≈øt be very vigilant, carefully ca≈øting his eyes about him, and harkning whether he hear the noi≈øe or approach of any drawing neer him; which if he perceive, he is pre≈øently to command them to ≈øtand, pre≈øenting his Musket or Pike to their bre≈øt, after calling his Corporal for to take the Word, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs

he ≈øhould be commanded to come in ≈øilently. He is not to come off until he be relieved by the Corporal or Lan≈øpa≈ø≈øadoe.</p>
                        <p>His proper Po≈øture, being a Muskettier, is to have his Musket re≈øted, and loaded with Powder and Bullet, his Match cockt, and his Pan guarded; being a Pike-man, if he ≈øtand Sentinel in the night, he mu≈øt have his Pike cheek'd; if in the day, his Pike ordered: Or it may be a very proper Po≈øture for a Pike-man to ≈øtand Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel with his Pike in his left-hand, holding it a little below the cheeks thereof, and with his Sword drawn, being held in his right-hand, which I leave to judge, or to be made u≈øe of according to di≈øcretion, and as occa≈øion ≈øhall require.</p>

                        <p>A Gentleman of a Company ought to have ≈øuch worth in him as may make him capable to be a File-leader, or Captain of his File; and he more e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly above the re≈øt ought to be well skill'd in all the Po≈øtures of ≈øuch Arms he wears; and at convenient times in≈øtructing and teaching his File in the neat and graceful handling of their Arms. He ought to be of an undaunted courage and gallant re≈øolution, for the better Example and imitation of the re≈øt; who≈øe worth and valour many times indears them ≈øo much into the favour of their Commanders, that they rai≈øe them up to greater places of preferment. In the Low-Countries a Gentleman of a Company hath his full pay, having nothing kept back for after-reckonings, as common private Souldiers have. At his fir≈øt entrance he ≈øometimes ≈øtands Sentinel, to inform him≈øelf of the Duties thereof; but mo≈øt commonly he is placed to be a Sentinel <hi>perdu</hi> in time of imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either in the Field, or upon approaches. He is to lie <hi>perdu</hi> with his Sword and Pi≈øtol, not removing from his place till he be relieved; nor is he to retreat for one man, but in ca≈øe of more, then he is to fall back to the ≈øecond; and di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering an Enemy, he is to come off betimes, and ≈øilently to give the Alarum, whereby the <hi>Corps du Guard</hi> or Company may be provided for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. A Gentleman of a Company doth many times go the Round with the Captain of the Watch, or his Fellow-Gentlemen, who are likewi≈øe Rounders, either in the Field, or in Garri≈øon; and do give the Corporals of the Guards the Word, charging the Sentinels to look well about them. To conclude, he ought truely to love, re≈øpect, and obey his Captain, and to ≈øtick clo≈øe unto him, vindicating him upon ju≈øt occa≈øions, when he ≈øhall be wronged and injured by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mutinies of the common Souldiers, or others.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108706:104"/>
his charge and care of every Squadron thereof. And unto each of them there is a Lan≈øpa≈ø≈øadoe for an a≈ø≈øi≈øtant: for their Rule of Dignity, I conceive, it makes not much more matter then to make them the right-hand File-leader in every particular divi≈øion; but if any will be ≈øo curious to order them according to that, let them apply them≈øelves unto the former Rules for directions to the ≈øame. The Corporals duty in his Squadron is to teach and in≈øtruct them in the u≈øe of the Pike and Musket, and to have a Roll and Li≈øt of his men in his Divi≈øion or Squadron. And when a Souldiers name is cro≈ø≈øed out, he is to give notice unto his Serjeant; and when a new one ≈øhall ≈øupply his place, his care mu≈øt be to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruct and enable him in the Po≈øtures of ≈øuch Arms as he ≈øhall bear. Being with his Squadron upon his Guard, he is to provide them with Wood, Coal, Candle and light. Having an Out-guard, his care mu≈øt be to ≈øtrengthen it, his little <hi>Corps du Guard</hi> and Sentinels mu≈øt be forth according to the avenews or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on of the Enemy, whereby he prevents their cutting off or ≈øurpri≈øal; the negligence whereof proves both dangerous to them≈øelves, and the whole Army. Wherefore it behoves him to be very careful and vigilant to vi≈øit them, after giving them an e≈øpecial charge to be both faithful and careful in the great tru≈øt repo≈øed in them. He mu≈øt likewi≈øe pre≈øerve and keep the Word con≈øtant in his memory; when the Captain of the Watch goes the fir≈øt Round, he ≈øhall with his Sword drawn again≈øt his bre≈øt give it him, and receive ≈øuch Orders from him as he ≈øhall command him; but afterwards when the Round ≈øhall come again, he ≈øhall cau≈øe the Rounders or Gentlemen (with his Sword drawn) to give the Word to him before they pa≈øs. He ought never to go alone, being called forth by the Sentinel, but to have a Guard of three or four Muskettiers along with him, ≈øelected out of his <hi>Corps du Guard.</hi> He mu≈øt advi≈øe his Sentinels how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean them≈øelves upon the di≈øcovery of an Enemy, either to give an Alarum, or el≈øe to give notice without making a noi≈øe. And if upon his Guard he ≈øhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ob≈øerve, or be adverti≈øed by his Sentinels of the approach of the Enemy, then he is to have his men in readine≈øs with Bullets in their Muskets, and their Matches lighted; him≈øelf ≈øecretly coming in, giving intelligence unto his Captain, or other Superiour Officer, whereby they may all be in a readine≈øs before the Alarum be given. He is likewi≈øe to di≈øtribute Victual, Powder, Bullet and Match, unto his Squadron, and to take notice of the be≈øt experienced men, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to imploy them upon action upon the Watches. He mu≈øt cau≈øe re≈øpect to be given to the <hi>Corps du Guard;</hi> and ≈øilence to be kept, whether it be about the Walls or Gates, that ≈øo the noi≈øe may not hinder the hearing of the adverti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Sentinels. He is likewi≈øe to have an eye to their lives and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to take care of the Baggage and Money of ≈øuch as are hurt or ≈øick, and to be in his own carriage ≈øober, wi≈øe and di≈øcreet, for the avoiding ill example un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others.</p>

After, according to the ≈øeniority of the Captains, and their march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to di≈øtribute forth their Quarters as may be de≈øigned. Having thus far acted through the help of the Con≈øtables and Head-boroughs of tho≈øe places where the Regiment is to Quarter; and having drawn forth their Billets in a good and orderly way, he is before the Regiments entring the Quarters, to deliver the ≈øame to the Colonel, or other Field-Officers of that Regiment; and they to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it to the re≈øt of the Captains, to direct them to their Lodgings, with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Souldiers of their Company. And during the time that he is about the vi≈øiting the di≈øtribution of the Lodgings, all the Troops are to keep watch round about the place, and to ≈øend out to di≈øcover: he mu≈øt al≈øo be informed of the Lodgings of the whole Army, to know whom to give, or whom to receive Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity.</p>
                        <p>If the Quarter be in the open field, the Quarter-Ma≈øter-General ≈øhall appoint to each Quarter-Ma≈øter the place and ground which he ≈øhall take, which he is to di≈øtribute to the Serjeants of every Company of the Regiment, who are to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him in taking the depth, length and breadth of their Quarters, with the di≈øtances of the Alarum-place between the head of the Quarters and the Trench, and the true di≈øtance of the Streets betwixt the in-getting of each Captains particular Company.</p>
                        <p>When an Army or Regiment ≈øhall ≈øit down before a Town, or forraging place, to be≈øiege it, they are imployed ≈øometimes to be Forragers to fetch in provi≈øion for the Army, or particular Regiments.

For the finding out of the fitte≈øt and able≈øt per≈øons for this employment, it is mo≈øt e≈øpecially the duty of the Waggon-Ma≈øters, who are to ≈øee and enquire certainly, that they be men known and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in all po≈ø≈øible By-paths, Cro≈øs-ways, &amp;c. That they be able to give an accompt of the di≈øtance of places, of the evenne≈øs and ≈øtraightne≈øs of them, whether they be plain or crooked, hilly or ≈øtony, and difficult for pa≈ø≈øage; what Rivers, Hedges, Ditches and Bridges lye in the way, and which way (if there ≈øhall be ≈øeveral ways) is the ≈øafe≈øt and ≈øhorte≈øt, which the nearer or farther to or from the Enemies Quarters, which more probable for their approaches, as likewi≈øe for Quarter; what Forrage, what Water is to be had, and how convenient the way is for Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.

But if it ≈øhall appear that he be not the Captain, or the Corporal knowing him not ju≈øtly to be ≈øo, by a ju≈øt ≈øu≈øpition, he may then detain him (although he ≈øhal give him the Word) and then he ≈øhall further demand the Word of ≈øome other atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, from whom having received it, he may more ≈øafely permit them to pa≈øs; but of all others what≈øoever that ≈øhall attempt a pa≈ø≈øage, he is to receive the Word from them, and not deliver it to them.</p>
                     <p>The Captain him≈øelf having done the duty in per≈øon of pa≈ø≈øing the fir≈øt Round, upon his return, he is to ≈øend forth others upon the like duty, ≈øuch as he ≈øhall out of his di≈øcretion chu≈øe from his Main-guard, and may mo≈øt confide in, to whom he is to impart the Word at their ≈øetting forth upon the duty, and not before, with ≈øtrict admonitions, and full in≈øtructions what they are to do, and what way to take.</p>
                     <p>Now if he ≈øhall be ≈øupplyed with men enough upon his own Guard, he may at the ≈øame time command out ≈øeveral Rounders to be taken ≈øeveral wayes; who are diligently to ob≈øerve their directions given them, and to be very vigilant in the ob≈øervation of all things in their pa≈ø≈øage, both by the eye and the ear, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni≈øh the Sentinels (in ca≈øe of neglect) that all things be more carefully lookt unto in their duty. And of the≈øe Rounders likewi≈øe (as before) the foremo≈øt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel demands, <hi>Who goes there?</hi> When being an≈øwered ≈øatisfactorily, as by the name of the <hi>Round,</hi> or <hi>Friends,</hi> the permits them pa≈ø≈øage to the neere≈øt Sentinel,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:108706:109"/>
who having ≈øtopt them there, takes a further accompt, what, and who they are: Which is done by calling forth his Corporal, who placing the point of his Sword at one of their bre≈øts, takes the Word privatly, and ≈øo pa≈ø≈øes them by conduct to the furthe≈øt Sentinel. But if there ≈øhall happen a mi≈øtake in the Word, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral is either to ≈øecure them with him≈øelf, or by Guard to transfer them to the Main-guard.</p>
                     <p>Such as ≈øhall walk the Round, are to take a ≈øtrict accompt of all they meet, what, and who they are; and in ca≈øe of deficiency of an≈øwering ju≈øtly on the one ≈øide, or ≈øu≈øpition of the other, they are to ≈øecure and guard them to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Watch.</p>
                     <p>Now ≈øetting a≈øide tho≈øe Queries which ≈øome do make between Rounders and Counter-Rounders, if they meet, who ≈øhall give or take the Word; the be≈øt and ≈øafe≈øt cour≈øe is for them all, that before the Word be either given or taken, they go together to the neere≈øt <hi>Corps du Guard,</hi> and there to give the Word; after which they are to pa≈øs upon their duty again; and ≈øo having fini≈øhed the Round, and returning to the Captain of the Watch, he taketh accompt of them of the things that they have done and ob≈øerved in their duty and cour≈øe upon the Round; and thus the Captain ≈øtill ≈øupplies the Rounds ≈øucce≈ø≈øively by ≈øuch others as he ≈øhall take by ≈øeniority, and di≈øpo≈øe off for the like ≈øervice.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, that all di≈øorders, irregularities, and ≈øuch per≈øons as ≈øhall cau≈øe the ≈øame in a Town or Garri≈øon, may be found out and rectified, and that all dangerous accidents by fire or otherwi≈øe may be prevented; the Captain of the Watch commandeth out a Guard of Firelocks or Muskettiers, to view the Streets, and all ≈øu≈øpitious and irregular per≈øons as they take, they are to bring to the Main-Guard of this Guard, which is always conducted by a Serjeant, and is called the <hi>Patrouille:</hi> and if they happen to be Muskettiers, and not Firelocks; then they are to be every one provided of ≈øuch an in≈øtrument as may cover the lighted Matches, and keep them from di≈øcovery. From the≈øe al≈øo, as from the Rounders, the Captain of the Watch takes full accompt of all their pa≈ø≈øages and ob≈øervations on their duty.</p>
                     <p>When at any time any ≈øudden approach ≈øhall be made, or any Enemy di≈øcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Sentinel (who is to be firm &amp; con≈øtant to his Place and Po≈øture, till he ≈øhall be relieved) forthwith by firing gives the Alarm, and immediately ≈øeconds it by crying with a loud voice, <hi>Arm, Arm.</hi> When the Alarm is thus given, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Divi≈øions immediately led by their Officers, are orderly to march up to the Captain of the Main-Guard, to the intent that all Guards of the Garri≈øon may with expedition be made good; and it is nece≈ø≈øary that the≈øe in≈øtructions be given them indeed by the Serjeant-Major, when he ≈øhall give the Word to the Minor-Serjeants, who mu≈øt likewi≈øe inform their chief Officers of it, and from them the Souldiers are to be charged and acquainted therewith, that ≈øo upon all occa≈øions they may not be ignorant of this part of their duty, but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to perform it.</p>
                     <p>The duty of a Sentinel, is to ≈øtand in the Place and Po≈øture, a full hour, and no more; at which time the Corporal, or (in ca≈øe of his ab≈øence) his Lan≈øpa≈ø≈øadoe is to relieve him, and not onely him, but all the Sentinels that are out upon du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, relieving the farthe≈øt Sentinel fir≈øt (who falls in the Reer of the re≈øt) and ≈øo all the others backward in the like Order, and then conducts the relieved Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels back to the Guard again.</p>
                     <p>At an early hour of the morning appointed for beating up the Revally, the two Sentinels next unto the Guard are to retreat into it.</p>
                     <p>At the time appointed in the morning for opening of the Gates, the Serjeant-Major attended with a ≈øufficient Guard, repairs to the Governour, or place el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where alotted, and there receives the Keys; which being done, he is to unlock fir≈øt that Gate which is mo≈øt remote from danger of the Enemy, and the re≈øt in order an≈øwerable: but if it happen to be in place and time of imminent danger, the Major commandeth forth a party of Souldiers conducted by an able Officer to go fir≈øt, and make diligent ≈øearch for di≈øcovering of Ambu≈øcadoes, which may happen to be in any clo≈øe ≈øu≈øpected places, as Lanes, By-ways, Hedges, ruinous

                     <p>Upon the di≈øcharging of the Watch, to the end that every Officer and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier may have notice to make ≈øpeedy repair to their ≈øeveral Guards, each ≈øeveral Drum fir≈øt beats a Troop, and afterwards a March in the Main-guard.

                     <p>WHen any Commander or Souldier of worth ≈øhall be decea≈øed, a private Captain that would ≈øhew re≈øpect and honour by marching along with his Company attending the Corps to the place of burial, mu≈øt order his Souldiers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner.</p>
                     <p>They being ≈øummon'd by beat of the Drum, to meet at their u≈øual place of Rendezvous, they may be drawn up according to the u≈øual manner, having a Van-guard, Battail and Reer-guard: being thus ordered, and each of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers having either in his Hat a black Feather or Ribbin; the Captain may draw them off, and order them to their Long-march; moving them away in an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner unto the place of him that is decea≈øed, and there make Alt. After which he may command the Muskettiers in the Van to open to the right and left outward to ≈øuch convenient di≈øtance as the Pikes may move up between them, and take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of their fir≈øt ground; and tho≈øe Muskettiers may face about, and move down cleer of the Pikes, and after clo≈øe their Files inward to Order, and face to their Leader.</p>
                     <p>Now being in two Divi≈øions, let them ≈øo continue with their Arms ordered,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:108706:110"/>
until ≈øuch time as they ≈øhall perceive the Corps to be brought forth into the Street; then the Captain may face them all about, and move them ≈øome three Pikes length before the Corps; after which he may command his Muskettiers to perform their Funeral-Po≈øture, which is to have their Muskets under their left Arm, with the But-end upward, their Re≈øts likewi≈øe on that ≈øide trailing. After which the Pikes are to face again to their fir≈øt Front, and to lay the narrow end of their Pikes down upon the ground; after facing about to the left, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the But-end of their Pikes on their right ≈øide, conforming them≈øelves with the Muskettiers in their Funeral-Po≈øtures. In the next place, the En≈øign ≈øtrips his Colours off from the Staff, and ties them about his right Wa≈øt; putting a black Ribbon towards the very end of his Staff, he after faceth to the Body of Pikes, ≈øtanding in the Reer of them, and trailing his Staff in the ≈øame Po≈øture. Next followeth the Captain, having in his hand a Half-pike or Leading-≈øtaff, conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him≈øelf likewi≈øe to his Funeral-Po≈øture. Thus being all ready to march, and rightly faced toward that place where the Corps are to be interred, are after this manner following to lead and to bring up.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, which was the Reer-guard, is led by the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant; the next Divi≈øion of Muskettiers, that was formerly the Van-guard, is led by the ≈øecond Serjeant; the Body of Pikes, is led by the elde≈øt Serjeant, he trailing a Half-pike upon the head of them; the En≈øign bringing it up, and the Captain twelve foot ≈øhort of him bringing up the Reer of the whole Company. And after him the Mini≈øters marching ju≈øt before the Coffin; &amp; in the Reer, &amp; next unto it, the neere≈øt kindred, and after them tho≈øe that are invited to the Funeral.</p>
                     <p>Having thus ≈øtated the manner and order of the Military Part, with all others belonging thereunto, for any ordinary Funeral-occa≈øion; I ≈øhall in the next place proceed to ≈øhew their Order upon the March, and how each Arms ought to be di≈øpo≈øed before the Corps enter into the Church, with the re≈øt of the Train.</p>
                     <p>All per≈øons being ordered as before expre≈ø≈øed, the Drums being covered with Black-bays, and placed betwixt the ≈øecond and third Ranks in each Divi≈øion; and all being ready to move, the Drums may begin to beat their Funeral-March, and the Lieutenant leading them away, with the But-end of his Patti≈øon upward and comported; the re≈øt following, and marching in a lea≈øurable and ≈ølow way along together, until they come within a hundred foot of the Church-door, or place where the Corps are to be interred, there making Alt. After which, let the Muskettiers in their Ranks File to the right and left, not advancing ground; and face in oppo≈øition, making a Guard for the re≈øt to pa≈øs through, and re≈øting their Muskets, or putting the But-end thereof to the ground, with the Barrel towards them (which is a conformity to the Pikes being ordered.) In the mean time, let the Pikes advance their Arms, and immediately after move forward betwixt the Guard of Muskettiers, and let their Ranks afterward file to the right and left, making al≈øo a Guard, their Pikes being ordered, and they as the re≈øt, facing in oppo≈øition. Then let the Captain, who brings up the Reer of all his whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, move forward with the re≈øt to the Church-door; then falling off in re≈øpect of ordering his Company, the re≈øt of the Train Marching into the Church.</p>
                     <p>After which the Captain may cau≈øe them all to face to the Church, or to their Leader; he ≈øtanding then before the Church-door, commanding them to Rank again as they were. After every Leader may draw off his File, and ≈øet their Arms apart in each File by them≈øelves, and go in to hear part of the Sermon, if there ≈øhould be any ≈øuch order before-hand from their Captain, placing Sentinels to look to their Arms. And when Sermon is almo≈øt done, they ought to go forth of the Church, and draw forth the Files by ≈øome little warning of Drums, to be in readine≈øs to an≈øwer ≈øuch directions as they ≈øhall receive from their Captain; who may, if he have conveniency of room, draw all his Muskettiers into a Ring, and the Pikes in like manner on the out≈øide of them; and as ≈øoon as the Souldiers have notice (being all ready and pre≈øented) that the Body is laid down in the grave, they may upon warning of the Drum, give one volley of ≈øhot all together, and after make ready again, performing the ≈øame twice over more. After which, the En≈øign may put his Colours upon his Staff, and furl them up; then the Pikes may be drawn up again into one Body, and the Muskettiers into another; and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108706:111"/>
falling in the Reer of the Pikes, they may troop away. And a little before the place of lodging the Colours, they may make Alt, and the Muskettiers may ≈øleeve up by the out≈øide of the Pikes from the Reer, filing to the right and left, making a Guard for the Colours and Pikes to march through them; and being cleer, and the Colours lodged, they may face about again to the right, and give another volley of ≈øhot: but if there ≈øhould be ≈øuch a ≈øtreight of ground, that the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers cannot be drawn into a Ring; then they mu≈øt be otherwi≈øe di≈øpo≈øed of, by making them into two Ranks, the one on the one ≈øide of the Street, and the other on the other ≈øide, facing them either in oppo≈øition, or in an oblique man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: if in oppo≈øition, they mu≈øt pre≈øent very low, and give fire three times all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as before, with one volley after another; if oblique, the one Rank is to be faced towards the upper end of the Street, and the other towards the lower end, and ≈øo may fire with le≈øs danger to each other; the Pikes to be filed away to the right and left, behind the Muskettiers before they were thus faced. And again, where they have not length of ground to contrive the Muskettiers into two ≈øingle Ranks, they may fire all together as they ≈øtand at Order, mounting up the Muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles of their Muskets into the Air, without offending each other. Therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conveniency of the ground, it mu≈øt be the di≈øcretion of every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to order his men accordingly to perform his three volleys of ≈øhot in the mo≈øt gracefulle≈øt way; which being ended, they may all return to their Quarters. And thus much may ≈øuffice for ≈øatisfaction to any Commander in ordering his ≈øingle Company to any Funeral-occa≈øion, marching along of it ≈øelf.</p>

                     <p>WHen Companies are to march in a Regimental-way, care mu≈øt be had that the Regiment be fir≈øt drawn up according to this Rule. The Pikes to be in one Body, and the Muskettiers equally divided to flank that Body; after which let the Major make his Divi≈øions, appointing the places of every Captain and Lieutenant, where they ≈øhall lead, and where they ≈øhall bring up. After that they may move away towards the place or lodging of him that is to be interred, and there make Alt, opening the Van-guard or Muskettiers, and facing them to the Reer; then let the Body of Pikes and them interchange ground, that the Pikes may march next the Hear≈øe, in manner as before expre≈øt of a private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who≈øe ≈ømaller Bodies take Rule from the greater.

After which the whole Train may pa≈øs through in an orderly manner into the Church; the Souldiers in the mean time attending without until Sermon be pa≈ø≈øed over. And being all in a readine≈øs, they may give three ≈øeveral Peals, or Volleys of ≈øhot, according to ≈øuch warnings as ≈øhall be given them. After which the Souldiers being ranked again as they were, if they have conveniency of ground, the Major may cau≈øe the Captains to draw off their Companies, and troop home to their ≈øeveral Quarters, according to their be≈øt conveniency. But if they have not room, it will be mo≈øt propere≈øt for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor to command the Muskettiers to ≈øtand, and fir≈øt to rank the Pikes again as they were. Then let the Drums beat a Troop upon the head of the Pikes in the Reer of the Colours; and let the En≈øigns and Pikes fir≈øt troop away, through the Guard of the Muskettiers; who being cleer of them, and being led by the Colonel and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers there appointed, the Muskettiers may al≈øo rank again in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and fall in the Reer of the Pikes, following them until they come unto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place or ground for the Captains drawing off their Companies, as they ≈øhall receive order from the Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel or Major.

                  <p>WHereas this Book in the ≈øeveral Tracts thereof, with much variety doth ≈øet forth at large, as to their ≈øeveral kinds and changes, all your Military Motions and Po≈øtures, which may not only ≈øerve to give light to the unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, and lead them by the hand into the Military Gardens of Honour, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

places, where they are trained up, until by degrees they arrive unto perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but may delight and confirm the mo≈øt able and mo≈øt knowing Souldiers, whil≈øt here they read over tho≈øe ≈øeveral forms, in which heretofore they ≈øtood, when in ≈øo many Battails, with ≈øuch admirable ≈øucce≈øs they have both oppo≈øed and overcome their Enemies. And whereas even from hence may be extracted many excellent Directions and Rudiments of War, which may incourage and fully inable all active and gallant Spirits in this City of <hi>London</hi> to perform ≈øuch Commands, and to follow tho≈øe Conducts to which they ≈øhall be di≈øciplined by tho≈øe exqui≈øite and mo≈øt expert Souldiers, who ≈øhall train them up, either in the new Artillery, or any other ground of ≈øuch Honorable Imployment, and hereby be ≈øo fitted and furni≈øhed with all directions, that the performance of them ≈øhall render them mo≈øt acceptable: yet I cannot but confe≈øs, that through the u≈øual va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of this mo≈øt Noble Profe≈ø≈øion, proceeding from the great plenty which the≈øe times afford thereof (the exerci≈øe of Arms being every where ≈øo frequently ≈øhown) that the mo≈øt plain and ordinary Rules, though far more u≈øeful, are not ≈øo well relli≈øhed, many men looking more in ≈øuch your publick Trainings after novelty and delight, then ≈øolidity; which was purpo≈øely contrived by the Authors of it only for variety, and for drawing of one another to the love of Arms, and not for any prejudice to the Fundamentals of War, on which the Ruine or the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Kingdom and Commonwealth of the World depends. If peradventure it be alleadged, that he who can perform things of difficulty, will be more apt to carry on things of more facility: It may be ≈øpeedily an≈øwered, that the plain Rudiments and Principles of War, being of greate≈øt u≈øe and importance, and practi≈øed in all Armies, both in this and other Nations, they are by no means to be neglected or omitted, but to be pre≈øerved and e≈øteemed in that high manner which they do de≈øerve; for the ability in the performance of them, will no doubt more readily prefer a man, and render him more capable of any imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the practice of any u≈øele≈øs or impertinent things in War. Add unto this, that the more ea≈øie and plain a man is in his command, the more readily it is received by the Souldiers, and more promptly obeyed; for new coined, and Se≈øquipedalian words of Command do ≈øo puzzle and torment the apprehen≈øions with directions and expo≈øitions to have them under≈øtood, that not only they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes tran≈øcend the reach of tho≈øe that are to give them; but they do much amaze and confound the capacities of tho≈øe who are to be led and ordered by them. I do the rather make mention of this in this place, that a di≈øcreet care be taken, that no man make him≈øelf ridiculous in his undertakings or Commands; but that he may be able to give an ab≈øolute account of any Branch, which in the whole Body of the Art Military ≈øhall be propounded to him, to give ≈øatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therein to any judicious Souldier, as concerning the u≈øe, purpo≈øe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of it; for otherwi≈øe it would ≈øignifie nothing at all. But when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required thereunto can render a ≈øufficient rea≈øon for what he doth, or ≈øhall voluntarily give it him≈øelf, as to this or that management of any ≈øervice in War, it will very much both content him, and inform them who ≈øhall be under his Command, and give them a ju≈øt encouragement to proceed in it: but if he ≈øhould fail in this point of Knowledge and Judgment, there is but little benefit to be expected from his Conduct; for it were far better that a man did but a little in a Souldierly way, which is proper, and carrying good approbation to men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding, then to ≈øpin forth a long thred with new expre≈ø≈øions and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are of no u≈øe or profit, but tend rather unto laughter, and to the lo≈øs of time, and the offence of many, and to the bringing of a generall contempt upon the Art.</p>
                  <p>And although there be many Rules which may be ≈øufficient forms to direct, and to teach to be expert in War, and doubtle≈øs are of great concernment to them who have both the. Theorick and the Practick part; yet neverthele≈øs there is no rule, but at ≈øome time or other doth admit of ≈øome exception, there being e≈øpepially ≈øo many cro≈øs events in War, that no Commander can po≈øitively tie him≈øelf up to any Rule; for occa≈øions do vary ≈øo in ≈øeveral places, that the chiefe≈øt Rule a man can walk by, is his Eye, and his Intelligence, wherein accordingly he
<pb facs="tcp:108706:112"/>
mu≈øt accommodate him≈øelf to encounter his Enemies. And although a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander ≈øhould be qualified with much Knowledge, Courage and Faithfulne≈øs, the only accompli≈øhments of a true Souldier; yet they are to be attended with diligence; for in all his undertakings and performances, delays being always dangerous, it is u≈øually ≈øaid, <hi>That which is ≈øoonest done, and well done, is be≈øt done.</hi> But above all, he is to have an eye to order, which is the very life of an Army. And in acting again≈øt an Enemy, great care is to be taken not to puzzle the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, by confounding their under≈øtandings, which may occa≈øion their utter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow. And this makes me to reflect on what hath been mentioned hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Let every Commander that truly delights in Military exerci≈øes, ≈øtudy to be exact in all plain things, and practice the Souldiers much in the exerci≈øe thereof; for this is the only u≈øe, and is altogether practi≈øed and ob≈øerved in the Field. If a man will be curious in new fancies, there are ≈øtratagems enough to be found out, in which he may exerci≈øe him≈øelf with much variety, to delight the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and find much matter in them to be highly valued, and e≈øteemed. But this is to be carried on in a plain way, the ≈øtudy whereof would ask ≈øome time; and it is not ea≈øily obtained by ordinary capacities, which ≈øhould content them≈øelves to learn of ≈øuch who are of higher abilities. And on this account the Art would be more highly prized, and not only bring more Honour to the Profe≈ø≈øors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but even the Learners them≈øelves would become more capable of good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment abroad, and our Military Gardens and Meetings would much more flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh, and be beheld with more delight and ≈øatisfaction, not only by the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers them≈øelves, but all other Spectators what≈øoever.</p>
                  <p>I do not de≈øire to be mi≈ø-under≈øtood by this Di≈øcour≈øe, that herein I ≈øhould go about to ≈øtartle any ingenious Souldier, or di≈ø≈øwade him from any thing that ≈øhall be new to his Invention, which is proper: I ≈øhall rather incourage him, and be glad to under≈øtand of him what Rea≈øon he can give for every thing he doth, and of what u≈øe it may be unto the Publick, and then it will admit of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulment. But vacant ≈øea≈øons may be u≈øed for variety and delight, in making experiments of wit, fancy, and ingenuity; provided they do not dwell too much upon them. But the ≈øub≈øtantial and ≈øolid things of War are above all things to be preci≈øely regarded, without which an Army, though of the mo≈øt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men, will be expo≈øed to the greate≈øt dangers, and fall into a mo≈øt certain Ruine.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhould here humbly offer my Advice to the mo≈øt eminent Meetings in the Artillery and Military Gardens, in the latter of which I was heretofore a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ≈øtill am a true Lover, and honourer both of that, and all other places like unto it: My advice is, that on their days of publick Meeting, they would have chiefly before their eyes the main Grounds and Principles in the Art of War, which (through permi≈ø≈øion) I am per≈øwaded, would cau≈øe greater appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and make their Ground to flouri≈øh more then ever; to the Honour of our Nation, and the increa≈øe of experienced and able Commanders, if ever this Commonwealth ≈øhould ≈øtand in further need of them. And becau≈øe the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ≈øome doth ≈øtrive to aim at higher things in their thoughts then what is practi≈øed abroad, I have thought good to ≈øet down the plain way of exerci≈øing a Company, as u≈øually it is practi≈øed in the Army, our Companies con≈øi≈øting of one hundred men, two parts being Muskettiers, and a third Pikes, the depth of our Files being always ≈øix deep in the Armies of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> the Company being drawn up abre≈øt, the Exerci≈øe is as followeth, they ≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their clo≈øe≈øt Order in Ranks and Files.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Bring all the Muskettiers before the Pikes, then let them fire in the Front, falling off, and flank the Pikes upon the Right. Fire upon the right flank, the body marching, and the Muskettiers to pa≈øs on the left flank: after the Pikes may charge to the right, the body moving again. Let the Muskettiers fire on the left flank, and fall in the Reer of the Pikes, who may after charge their Pikes on the left. The body marching, the Muskettiers may fire in the Reer, and fall off to the Right and Left, and flank the Pikes as at the fir≈øt; the body facing about, the Pikes may charge to the Reer. We u≈øually fire in the Front ≈øometimes two ranks ≈øtanding, the re≈øt pa≈ø≈øing by turns; then ≈øtanding after they have gained the ground before their Leaders, do fire, till all have fired twice: other times three Ranks fire together; the fir≈øt kneels down, the ≈øecond ≈øtoops, the third ≈øtands upright; then falling down, the three la≈øt Ranks pa≈øs through, and do the like. This being done twice, reduces them all as at fir≈øt, the Pikes moving ≈ølowly; this being the u≈øual way of exerci≈øing our Companies in the Army.</p>

                  <head>A SUPPLEMENT TO THE COMPLEAT BODY OF The Art Military.</head>
                  <head>How the Officers of an Army in general ought to be qualified.</head>
                  <p>IN every Souldier (e≈øpecially a Commander) the≈øe e≈ø≈øential qualities are required, <hi>viz.</hi> Knowledge, Experience, Valour and Dexterity; of which, how many are there that take upon them the profe≈ø≈øion of a Souldier, that hardly know what any of the Words mean; but think their patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony a ≈øufficient Commi≈ø≈øion for them, to take a Command upon them, they wanting Knowledge how to manage the men under their Command; Experience in the Art Military being a ≈øtranger to them. But certainly, if ≈øuch men did but ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øider how various and changeable the ≈øtate of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is, that in a moment he may loo≈øe that honour and reputation he hath been many years obtaining, and ≈øeen the ignominie and di≈øgrace which ≈øome have come unto by their mi≈øcarriages, they would doubtle≈øs be very cautious, and not run headlong into an imployment of ≈øuch importance.</p>
                  <p>But he that hath had experience by being under command for a time, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the degree of a Captain gradually, as from a Corporal to a Quarterma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, thence to a Cornet, and ≈øo to a Lieutenant; he is then well prepared for a Captains charge: for having pa≈ø≈øed the≈øe inferior Offices, depre≈ø≈øeth tho≈øe vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pa≈ø≈øions which by nature otherwi≈øe are apt to ari≈øe in young men, which in a Commander are dangerous: Be≈øides, his accu≈øtoming him≈øelf to the former employments, maketh him Valorous; ≈øo that if he be ≈øuddenly a≈ø≈øailed, he can recollect him≈øelf without a≈øtoni≈øhment; and to the forementioned Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons adde this, his accu≈øtoming him≈øelf to hard≈øhip, as to Watch, Travel, Labour, endure Hunger and cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His chief end mu≈øt be Honour; to attain which, he mu≈øt be vigilant, and let no opportunity ≈ølip to attempt any brave exploit or ≈øtratagem. And for that end he will be always ob≈øerving his Enemy, and contriving how to circumvent him in his de≈øigns; knowing that in War no material matter can be effected without vigilancie and danger. But let him not always tru≈øt to his own judgement, but advi≈øe with his Officers al≈øo; and upon any ≈øuch enterprize let him take to his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance ≈øuch of his Souldiers as he ≈øees de≈øerve well, and quit him≈øelf at ≈øuch a time of the debauched part of his Souldiery. He mu≈øt always a≈øpire to higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

                  <p>But above all, let him ≈øee before his eyes the fear of God, deporting him≈øelf internally and externally blamele≈øs. Thus by good Example of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the commanded will be reformed.</p>
                  <p>Having given you an account how every Commander in general ought to be qualified, I will now ≈øhew you the Office, Duty, and Qualification of every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in particular. And</p>

                     <p>THe General of the Hor≈øe was wont to ≈øupply the place of Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Army, and in the ab≈øence of the Lord General to command the whole Army. It is true, that the Lord Mar≈øhal, fora≈ømuch as he giveth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (according to the opinions of ≈øome) u≈øed to have the ≈øuperiority of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; whence it is, that the Lord General ab≈øenting him≈øelf from the Army, u≈øed to take along with him either the General of Hor≈øe, or the Lord Mar≈øhal, to avoid competition between them.</p>
                     <p>He mu≈øt be a man of Experience and Valour, having in charge the nerves of the principal Forces, and upon whom the ≈øucce≈øs of many de≈øigns and actions depend, they being u≈øually executed by the Cavalry, where the charging of the Enemy orderly u≈øually giveth Victory; and the di≈øorderly charging, di≈øturbs oft-times the whole Army. Witne≈øs that Battle at <hi>Gembloers</hi> de≈øcribed by <hi>Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> where the Infantry were overthrown by their own Hor≈øe. He is to take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice not only of the Officers, but the private Souldiers al≈øo, rewarding them when vigilant, and upon ≈øome ≈øignal act advancing them to higher pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, and puni≈øhing Delinquents and ≈øuch as are deficient in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: by which means the good will love, and the bad fear him. He is to ≈øee the Cavalry be furni≈øhed with all nece≈ø≈øaries, and be always in good equipage. A Troop being to march, he is to ≈øee that they be provided with Naggs, for the pre≈øervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Souldiers Hor≈øes; for with them they mu≈øt go to forrage after their March, and pre≈øently enter into Guard or Quarter without re≈øt, to refre≈øh their Hor≈øes. The Captains are not to ab≈øent them≈øelves from their Companies, nor to place of di≈øplace Officers without his leave and approbation. He hath his particular Officers a part; and in that which concerneth the Cavalry, neither Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhal nor General him≈øelf di≈øpo≈øe of any thing without his advice. When he pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth through the Quarters either of the Cavalry or Infantry, his Trumpets are to ≈øound; but not where the Lord General is pre≈øent, or where he lodgeth. When he commandeth in the Army (in ab≈øence of the Lord General) upon occa≈øion of fight, his place is in the Battle, that he may the better give Order to all. U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øually he hath a Company to lodge with him, to ≈øerve him as his Guard, and ≈øix or more of his Company attending on him. He ≈øhould not re≈øolve upon any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, unle≈øs he con≈øider of all that might happen, and propound to him≈øelf greater difficulties in the action then in reality there be, and ≈øo prepare reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ≈øurpa≈ø≈øing the ≈øaid difficulties, it being a ≈øingular benefit to be able to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øee (with good judgement) tho≈øe things which might ≈øucceed in the uncertain and variable accidents of War.

part with the Cavalry: he ought to be well ver≈øed in the ways of the Country, that he may either meet or avoid his Enemy as occa≈øion ≈øhall required. He mu≈øt be always bu≈øied about his Enemies motion, con≈øidering with him≈øelf from what place they may ≈øhew them≈øelves, with what number, whether Infantry or Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; in what time they may probably come upon him, and where to place him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to advantage to prevent them.</p>
                     <p>He mu≈øt be circum≈øpect and wary in the choice of the place appointed for Quarters, in preparing good Guards, cau≈øing the High-ways to be cleared, and by-ones di≈øcovered, placing men on tho≈øe places where he ≈øuppo≈øes the Enemy may make head; ≈øending forth Scouts continually, and placing Sentinels, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no diligence to ≈øecure the Quarter where the Cavalry findeth it ≈øelf to be expo≈øed to mo≈øt danger, e≈øpecially if they be lodged without Infantry. He mu≈øt be ≈øure to have Spies in and about his Enemies Quarters. He mu≈øt look that the Captains wrong not their Souldiers, but that he ≈øee them well armed, and kept in good Order, and that they and his Officers ob≈øerve good Orders and Di≈øcipline. As he ought to be ≈øevere in puni≈øhing, ≈øo he mu≈øt be ready and willing to hear his Souldiers ju≈øt complaints, and relieve them. He mu≈øt not ≈øuffer any extortion to be u≈øed by him≈øelf or others, by which the Country is ruined, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery hated: for too great liberty of the Souldiers produceth bad effects.</p>
                     <p>He ought to be knowing in the command of the Infantry; for upon occa≈øion of ≈øending a good part of the Cavalry to ≈øeveral places, he hath the charge not only of the Hor≈øe, but of the Foot al≈øo: And in the ab≈øence of the General, the Orders from the Lord General or Lord Mar≈øhal come to him, and to him are all reports made of the occurrences of the Cavalry and Army. He may ≈øu≈øpend a Captain of his command, upon ju≈øt cau≈øe; but cannot re≈øtore him again without order from the General, who mu≈øt fir≈øt give notice thereof to the Lord General. When he pa≈ø≈øeth the Quarters of Cavalry, the Trumpets ≈øound; but not in the pre≈øence of the General, or in his Quarters. When the General of Hor≈øe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the whole Army, and therefore takes his place in the Battle, the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General placeth him≈øelf in the Van-guard of the Cavalry, where otherwi≈øe the General u≈øeth to be.</p>

                     <p>A Captain ought to be a man Sober, Continent, and mode≈øt in his Apparel, aiming rather at good Arms and Hor≈øes, then gorgeous Apparel; to ≈øee his Souldiers punctual in their re≈øpective Duties, and often calling them to exerci≈øe.

                     <p>IN the ab≈øence of the Captain and Lieutenant, the Cornet is to command the Troops, but in the Captains pre≈øence upon a March, his place is in the Front before the fir≈øt Rank, but behind the Captain: in his charging of an Enemy, he is to charge with the Captain, and endeavour to break his Standard upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; and being broken, and falling to the ground, he is not to regard taking it up again, his honour lying much in the breaking of his Standard in cha≈øe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Hor≈øe or Foot: But if the Enemy ≈øhould take the Cornets Standard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken, it were to him a great di≈øgrace. And this is contrary to the practice of an En≈øign in the Infantry, the pre≈øerving of who≈øe Colours is ever e≈øteemed his greate≈øt glory; as is evident in the Example of one <hi>Jaques Martaeus,</hi> who, when mo≈øt of his Souldiers had for≈øaken him, he fought ≈øo long as he could; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him≈øelf over-powred, wound him≈øelf up in his Colours and dyed.</p>
                     <p>The Cornet of Cuira≈ø≈øiers in march hath his place at the head of the Troop, and pre≈øenteth him≈øelf in the Alarm-place; but in fight, in the mid≈øt of the Troop, having two third parts of the Souldiers behind him. [And this is the place of his marching in the≈øe times, which does mo≈øt agree with the manner of marching of the Infantry, where the En≈øign marches before the divi≈øion of Pikes.] The Souldiers in the Front-divi≈øion of the Troop, mu≈øt be tho≈øe be≈øt armed, and the mo≈øt couragious. He mu≈øt keep a Li≈øt of the Troop, and ≈øend ≈øo many to the Guard, as the Captain or Lieutenant ≈øhall appoint. Once every day, he is at the Lord-Generals pa≈ø≈øing by the Troop to do obey≈øance to him, by inclining his body and Cornet towards the ground.</p>

There is much tru≈øt repo≈øed in him, as the di≈øtributing of the Word and the Billets; and therefore ought to be hone≈øt and true to his charge. When he goes with the Quarter-Ma≈øter-General to make the Quarters or Lodgings, he mu≈øt be very diligent, taking with him two or three of his Souldiers, which are to return to their Troop, as guides to conduct the re≈øt to their Quarters.</p>

If to face or turn to the Left about, then a little harder.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter every motion performed, it were good to keep him ≈øome ≈ømall time in that motion: As when you bid him ≈øtand, to ≈øtand a while, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Al≈øo it were not ami≈øs (after every thing well performed) to give him ≈øome Bread or Gra≈øs for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

                        <p>For the more ea≈øie and ≈øpeeding lading of the Pi≈øtol, for the gaining of time, and avoiding the carrying of either Flask or Touch-box, there is an invention of a Spanner or Key, which contains ≈øix Charges of Powder at the lea≈øt, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-Powder ≈øufficient for tho≈øe Charges, and for the Cartouches wherewith the Pi≈øtol-ca≈øes be furni≈øhed; which the Cuira≈ø≈øier will find to be of very good u≈øe.</p>
                        <p>The Cartouches are made of white Paper, cut into convenient breadth and length, and rowled upon the Rammer or other ≈ømall round ≈øtick; the edge being pa≈ø≈øed down, and the Rammer drawn out, one end of the Paper is to be doubled in, to keep the Powder from falling out: the≈øe Cartouches are to be made ≈øo big, as to fill neerly the bore of the Pi≈øtol, and of length to contain as much Powder as the Pi≈øtol requires for a Charge. When the Powder is in, tie it with thred, and then put in the Bullet al≈øo, tying that al≈øo; the≈øe the Souldier may make at ≈øpare hours, and have them always by him. When he u≈øes his Cartouches, he mu≈øt bite off the Paper at the head of it, and ≈øo put it into the Barrel of the Pi≈øtol with the Bullet upwards, and then ram it home: the≈øe being beforehand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, it will much expedite the work of lading his Pi≈øtol.</p>
                        <p>The Cuira≈ø≈øier being well mounted, and throughly exerci≈øed in his Po≈øtures, the next thing he ≈øhould apply him≈øelf unto is, to be a good Marksman; to attain which, he mu≈øt be frequently ≈øhooting at Marks on Horsback, having ≈øuch ≈øet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Tree, ≈øome higher and ≈øome lower.</p>
                        <p>The Cuira≈ø≈øier being armed Pi≈øtol-proof, he mu≈øt not give fire but at a very neer di≈øtance, being careful to make his Bullet do execution: the principal place of advantage to aim at is, the lower part of the belly of his Enemy, his arm-pits, or his neck. Some are of opinion, that it is not fitting for a Cuira≈ø≈øier to give fire, till he have his Pi≈øtol under his Adver≈øaries Armor, or again≈øt ≈øome unarmed place; and if he mi≈øs of an opportunity of hitting the man, he may aim at the head or bre≈øt of his Hor≈øe. He is commonly to give the charge upon a Trot, and ≈øeldome galloppeth, but upon a pur≈øuit. Having ≈øpent both his Pi≈øtols, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no opportunity to load again, he mu≈øt then betake him≈øelf to the la≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, his Sword, placing the Pummel of it upon his right thigh, and with his

right hand to direct the point thereof by his eye, rai≈øing it higher or lower as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion ≈øerveth, aiming at his Enemies Neck, Arm-pits, Eye, or about the Pummel of the Saddle at his Belly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but being pa≈øt his Enemy, he is to make a back-blow at him, aiming to cut the buckle of his Poldron, thereby di≈øarming one of his Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>THe Hor≈øman being ≈øufficiently in≈øtructed in the managing of his Hor≈øe, and in the u≈øe of his particular Arms; it is time now that he be taught how to demean him≈øelf being joyned in a Body.</p>
                        <p>The Hor≈øe being to be exerci≈øed, is to be drawn up into a Body, not by Ranks (as in the Infantry) but by Files, and tho≈øe of 5 deep, according to mo≈øt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; or of 6 deep, according to others, that of 5 being a number not divi≈øible by 2, ≈øo that in doubling of Ranks, or Half-files, or the like, there will always remain an odd Rank. Others would have them (e≈øpecially the Harquebu≈øiers) to be 8 in File, making the Troop to con≈øi≈øt of 64 Men, being drawn up into a ≈øquare Body. Being thus put into Battalia, the fir≈øt thing they are to be in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in, is Di≈øtance; and herein there is a di≈øagreement among Authors; Some making Clo≈øe order to be 2 paces; Open order 4 paces, and ≈øo forward to a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, quadruple Di≈øtance proportionable. Others make but two kinds of Di≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Clo≈øe order, which is 3 foot; and Open order, which is 6 foot. And here a difference is to be ob≈øerved between the manner of taking the Di≈øtance of the Cavalry, and that of the Infantry; for in the Foot, the Di≈øtance is taken from the Center, or middle of the Souldiers Body, which here cannot be under≈øtood but only of the ≈øpace of Ground between Hor≈øe and Hor≈øe. But the be≈øt and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt Authors are of opinion, that the Cavalry being to be exerci≈øed in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ≈øhould be at their Di≈øtance of 6 foot or Open order, ≈øtanding right in their Ranks and Files.</p>

                     <p>You are to ob≈øerve, that the Army is to be divided into Van-guard, Battail and Reer; and becau≈øe the Van is the mo≈øt honourable place, they change eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, ≈øo that he that hath the Van this day, hath the Reer to morrow; and he that had the Battle, marcheth in the Van; ≈øo likewi≈øe he that had the Reer the fir≈øt day, marcheth in the Van the third day: and this Order doth the Regiment in every <hi>Tertia</hi> al≈øo follow.</p>
                     <p>Being thus divided, they are all upon Order given by the General to ≈øtand ranged in Battalia, either in their ≈øeveral Quarters, or in ≈øome place of Arms ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the whole Army; and ≈øtanding ≈øo in readine≈øs, Command being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to March,</p>

is opened or covered, and always keep three or four Hor≈øe a Mu≈øquet ≈øhot before them, to prevent any ≈øudden ≈øurpri≈øe; and if they di≈øcover any Enemies, they are pre≈øently to ≈øend a Hor≈øe-man to adverti≈øe their Troops, and they likewi≈øe to give notice to the Army.</p>
                     <p>They mu≈øt al≈øo diligently inform them≈øelves, as neer as po≈ø≈øibly they can with the ≈øtrength of the Enemy, and ≈øtill ≈øend Me≈ø≈øengers with adverti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by whom they ≈øhall al≈øo receive Order, how they ≈øhall retire or di≈øpo≈øe of them≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>After them ≈øhall follow 1000 with Fire-locks and Half-pikes, divided into ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Troops, as well to ≈øuccour the ≈øaid Hor≈øe, as to guard the Ordnance of the Van-guard that follow; and they ≈øhall al≈øo ≈øend fifty men on either Flank, with ≈øufficient Officers to di≈øcover and keep off ≈ømall parties.</p>
                     <p>Then ≈øhall march two Companies of Pioniers, to even the way for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery; and with them one Waggon with Materials, and an other with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals.</p>

                     <p>Then three Quarter-cannon likewi≈øe charged, and attended by one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, two Gunners, one Waggon loaden with Powder, one with Bullets, and one Conductor.</p>

                     <p>Next ≈øhall follow 2000 Hor≈øe, marching in a good di≈øtance by Regiments or Troops, and in good Order.</p>
                     <p>After them the Van-guard of Foot con≈øi≈øting of 7000, and marching orderly by Regiments, at their appointed di≈øtances.</p>
                     <p>There ≈øhall follow them half the Ammunition and Victuals for the Army; then the Generals and Chief Officers Waggon; and la≈øtly, the particular Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons belonging to the Van-guard, and half of that which belongs to the battail, marching, and taking place in the ≈øame Order, as do the Regiments they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto in their ≈øeveral Bodies.</p>
                     <p>Then ≈øhall march the Battail, con≈øi≈øting likewi≈øe of 7000 Foot, followed with the re≈øt of the Ammunition, Vivers and baggage of the Battail; and al≈øo with that which belongs to the Reer.</p>
                     <p>After them ≈øhall march in well ordered Divi≈øions, the Reer of the Foot con≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 6000 Foot, and next 2000 Hor≈øe, as afore≈øaid.</p>
                     <p>Then (in the ≈øame order as is mentioned in the Van-guard) ≈øhall march four Half-cannons, three Quarter-cannon, and eight Field-pieces accompli≈øhed with their appurtenances, as Powder, Bullets, nece≈ø≈øary In≈øtruments, and ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent per≈øons to manage and attend them.</p>
                     <p>Next them 1000 Fire-locks to guard the Ordnance, and ≈øuccour the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn-hope of the Reer, as is afore≈øaid.</p>
                     <p>La≈øtly, (to clo≈øe up the Army) ≈øhall march 500 Hor≈øe, ob≈øerving the ≈øame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as is pre≈øcribed them in the Van-guard.</p>

If he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, he may place his baggage before the Van-guard of the Foot, ever taking care to appoint a ≈øufficient guard to attend it: and in an open Country,

where the Troops may march in Battalia, the Waggons may well march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Troops, placing them≈øelves likewi≈øe in Ranks, and making a Front as large as the Body they follow; ≈øo ≈øhall they take up but little ground, and be no trouble at all: and there they are out of danger, which otherwi≈øe they will be ≈øubject to, if an Enemy be neer, and ≈øtrong in Hor≈øe.</p>

                     <head>What Rules are to be ob≈øerved in the choice of the Ground to Quarter in.</head>
                     <p>IN chu≈øing your Ground for your Quarters, let it as neer as you can be upon high Ground, le≈øt your Enemy being higher, may have an advantage of you by that means.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let it be neer no Woods nor Groves, where your Enemy may lie in ambu≈øh, and ≈øally out upon you, and vex you; yet let it not be very far from neither Wood nor Water, they being two as nece≈ø≈øary things as can be. But let the Ground be champion, the better to di≈øcern your Enemy at a di≈øtance; and if po≈ø≈øible, neer ≈øome River, for the relief of Men and Cattle, and for the cheaper conveying of nece≈ø≈øaries for the u≈øe of the Souldiery.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. See that the Ground you quarter upon be not at any time ≈øubject to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow with Water, nor that any Water be let in upon you by Slu≈øes or otherwi≈øe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That no boggy, moori≈øh, or unwhol≈øome Grounds be neer your <hi>Quarters,</hi> which may be a means to bring Di≈øea≈øes and Sickne≈øs among the Souldiers.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That Forrage, Wood, and Straw be neer you, or may be ea≈øily conveyed to you.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the <hi>Quarters</hi> be not too neer your Enemy, for fear of their Cannon; nor very far di≈øtant, but that timely relief may be given to the approachers.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That the Ground be of a competent largene≈øs to contain the number of Companies, Hor≈øe, Foot, Artillery, and other nece≈ø≈øaries thereunto belonging, with allowance of fit dimen≈øions for every particular.</p>
                     <p>But it will rarely fall out that any place you can chu≈øe will have all the≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, wherefore gain as many of them as you can, and for the re≈øt you mu≈øt by indu≈øtry ≈øupply. Wherefore (above all) let the Fortifications and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments about your <hi>Quarters</hi> be well made and guarded, le≈øt by the neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them you be ≈øurprized, and your Enemy hinder your relief.</p>

                     <head>How the Quarter-ma≈øter is to de≈øign his Quarters when the Ground is cho≈øen.</head>
                     <p>THis work is not to be done of a ≈øudden, but the Quarter-ma≈øter knowing the place where the <hi>Quarters</hi> are to be, let him go to his Chamber, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult with his Li≈øt which he is to quarter; namely, how many Regiments of Hor≈øe, how many of Foot, what Waggons, what Artillery, and what≈øoever el≈øe, as Sutlers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is to quarter; al≈øo how many Companies there is in each Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and how many men in each Company.</p>

                     <p>By help of the≈øe parallel Lines he may lay his pa≈øt-boards upon this paper, and move them this way and that way, till he have brought them into a Square, or <hi>Parallelogram,</hi> or as regular a form as they will permit.</p>
                     <p>He having thus di≈øpo≈øed them to the be≈øt advantage in his judgment, he may draw a Scheme or Plat thereof upon fair Paper or Parchment, writing the name of every Colonel and his number of men upon his particular <hi>Quarter,</hi> with the Generals <hi>Quarters,</hi> Market, Streets, Lanes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> making thereof a perfect Map; and adding a Scale thereto, he may mea≈øure the di≈øtance of any part thereof at plea≈øure.

Then going to his In≈øtrument, let him turn the Index about to a right Angle from the line <hi>A B,</hi> and looking through the ≈øights towards <hi>C,</hi> let him cau≈øe 1700 foot (the breadth of his <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>) to be laid out upon the ground from <hi>A</hi> to D, and at <hi>D,</hi> let them cau≈øe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Standard to be erected, of the Colours of the Regiment that is there to be quartered.</p>
                     <p>This done, let him remove his In≈øtrument from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>D,</hi> and at the place where his In≈øtrument ≈øtood, let there be erected another Standard. The In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being placed at <hi>D,</hi> and the Index laid upon the Diameter thereof, let him turn the In≈øtrument about, till through the ≈øights he ≈øee the Standard at <hi>A,</hi> and then fixing it there, turn the Index about till it be removed a right Angle (or 90 <hi>deg.</hi>) from the Diameter; then looking through the ≈øights, cau≈øe 3000 foot to mea≈øured from <hi>D</hi> to <hi>C.</hi> La≈øtly, remove your In≈øtrument to <hi>C,</hi> and laying the Index on the Diameter thereof, turn it about, till through the ≈øights you ≈øee the Standard at <hi>D,</hi> and fixing the In≈øtrument there, remove the Index to a right Angle from the Diameter; and then looking through the ≈øights (if you have

                     <p>Thus are the four grand Angles of the Quarters found in the Field. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with any of the Regiments that are to be quartered in any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, as with that at <hi>B,</hi> look in your Draught, and ≈øee how many foot in length is allotted for it, which is 676; then mea≈øure that out from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>O,</hi> and ≈øet up a Standard there; then ≈øee how many foot broad that Quarter is, <hi>viz.</hi> 300, and mea≈øure that out from <hi>B</hi> to <hi>K,</hi> and there al≈øo ≈øet up a Standard. Then the length 676, and the bredth 300, being mea≈øured both ways from <hi>K</hi> to <hi>S,</hi> and from <hi>O</hi> to <hi>S,</hi> then erecting a Standard al≈øo; the≈øe two la≈øt Standards at <hi>O</hi> and <hi>K,</hi> will finde the place where the fourth Standard at <hi>S</hi> is to be erected. So is the ground laid out for one of the Angular Regiments; the like mu≈øt be done for the other three, and al≈øo for all the re≈øt.</p>
                     <p>A≈ø≈øoon as any <hi>Quarter</hi> for a Regiment is laid out by the Quarter-ma≈øter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the particular Quarter-ma≈øter of that Regiment begins to ≈øubdivide his <hi>Quarter</hi> according to the number of his men, putting down a ≈øtick at each end of every row of Huts and Streets end.</p>
                     <p>Then the Serjeants of every Company pre≈øently fall a dividing the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Huts, and ≈øet up four ≈øticks at the corner of each Hut: then the two Souldiers that lodge together build their Huts; and ≈øo the re≈øt.</p>
                     <p>In the Souldiers building of their Huts, the Serjants are to ≈øee that they build them regularly, and not incroach one upon another, but as their Ground is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted them. And to this the Superior Officers al≈øo are to have an eye.</p>

                     <p>At this 206 foot di≈øtance, the Pioniers dig a Trench or Furrow of about half a foot broad, and ≈øo much deep. Without or in this Furrow is the beginning of a Ditch ≈øix foot broad, to be digged round about the Quarters, which is to be done by the Foot-Souldiers, it being for their ≈øecurity.</p>
                     <p>Then the Enginier is to con≈øider how many foot of Ditch there is about the whole <hi>Quarters,</hi> and with that number goes to the Quarter-ma≈øter-General, and enquires of him the number of the Infantry; and by the≈øe two they compute how much of the Ditch each Regiment mu≈øt dig: thus,</p>
                     <p>If the number of ditching be 7500 foot, and the number of the Infantry is 8560.</p>
                     <p>Now ≈øuppo≈øe one Regiment contain 1320 Souldiers, how much of that Ditch mu≈øt that Regiment dig?</p>
                     <p>Multiply 1320 by 7500, and it produceth 99100. which being divided by 8560 giveth 1157 and about three quarters, and ≈øo many yards mu≈øt that Regiment dig which hath 1320 men in it.</p>

                     <p>THe rea≈øons that moved the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to remove the Captains from the Front, and place them as they are lodged in this la≈øt Quarter in the Reer, I take to be three; Fir≈øt, becau≈øe the Souldiers upon any ≈øudden occa≈øion, could not readily draw out into the Alarm-place, by rea≈øon of the narrow Streets between the Captains Huts. Secondly, becau≈øe the Colours and Arms lay hid by the Captains Huts, which now ≈øtand open in the eye of the Alarm-place, and make a hand≈øome ≈øhew, being likewi≈øe readier for the Souldier to draw out in an in≈øtant. La≈øtly to prevent the many in≈øolencies and di≈øorders commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the Sutlers, which he pre≈øumed the Souldiers dur≈øt not do, not the Sutlers ≈øuffer, the Captains being lodged ≈øo neer them.</p>
                     <p>You may ob≈øerve, that in this lu≈øt form of Quartering, there are 20 foot of the 200 allowed the Souldiers in depth taken off, and added to the ≈øtreet between the Captains and the Sutlers; for the ≈øtreet being in the former Quarter but 20 foot broad, was found to be too narrow for the Waggons, and Carriages to pa≈øs to and fro, which did continually go and come through it with Provi≈øions for the Army.</p>
                     <p>And whereas in the allowance of 200 foot in depth for the Souldiers, there were but two allotted to lodge or hut together, it happened ≈øometimes that they came to quarter in places where there was ≈ømall ≈øtore of Provi≈øion to but, withal ≈øo that the Souldiers could neither fit the ground allotted to them, nor make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny uniform or hand≈øome huts; therefore it was thought fit to take from them the ≈øaid 20 foot, and to allow them but 180.</p>
                     <p>Note, that the Officers mu≈øt ≈øee the Souldiers build formally, and that they make their Beds a foot and half or two foot from the ground, to prevent ≈øickne≈øs, which they will be ≈øubject to fall into by lying upon the ground.</p>

                     <p>THe Hor≈øe (unle≈øs pre≈ø≈øed by an Enemy) are always or mo≈øt commonly quartered in Hou≈øes, both for the commodity of Forrage, and that their Hor≈øes may ≈øtand under covert; which otherwi≈øe, by ≈øtanding three or four nights in rain and cold, would be in danger to be ≈øpoiled and made un≈øervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>So careful (≈øaith <hi>Melzo</hi>) was the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> of his Hor≈øe, that he not only quartered them in Hou≈øes, but made Courts of Guard upon the Avenues and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they watched, to ≈øhelter them from the weather. But ≈øeeing they may be ≈øometimes forced to make Huts, I will ≈øhew you their manner of Quartering, which is the ≈øame as the Foot, but that they have more ground allowed them, e≈øpecially in bredth: for their main ≈øtreets are twenty foot broad, and the men have ten foot allowed them; whereas the Foot have but eight foot for either Hut: their Hor≈øes are allowed ten foot in bredth, and four in depth: ≈øo the ground allowed for 100 Hor≈øe, is 300 foot in depth, and 70 in bredth.</p>

                     <p>TO make a good Retreat, is one of the Ma≈øter-pieces of a General; nor is it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhonorable for him to take the advantage of any time that he finds u≈øeful for the ≈øafety of his Army, and good of the Cau≈øe; although ≈øome young Souldiers (more hardy then wi≈øe) think it a di≈øparagement to retire in the night: but he that will not retire in the night, when rea≈øon and the benefit of his party doth require, may ≈øtay and be beaten in the day. Many Examples there are in Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of Armies that have been lo≈øt by ≈øuch gallantry, and their party thereby rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. There is no experienced General ≈øo indi≈øcreet or ill advi≈øed, as to follow a retiring Enemy with his Gro≈øs in the night, e≈øpecially if he find him retire in good order; for ≈øo he may be drawn into Ambu≈øcadoes, or his enemy may wait for him in places of advantage, and do him an affront, and what knows he when he finds the Retreat made orderly, but his Enemy ≈øeeks to draw him out purpo≈øely to intrap him? by this means the party retiring may before day get into a place of ≈øafety; whereas if he retire by day, his Enemy may ≈øafely follow him with his whole Army, and pa≈øs upon all advantages, whereof he ≈øhall find plenty in a well-ordered Army, if he know how to make u≈øe of them, and take his opportunity.

therefore conclude, that to retire by night, without ≈øound of Drum, with match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es covered, or to u≈øe any other ≈øecret way to avoid an Enemy when occa≈øion doth require, is not di≈øhonorable, but the duty of a good Captain.</p>

                           <head>Of Irregular Fortifications.</head>
                           <p>TOuching Irregular Fortifications, I can give no new Precept; only in the general, it is be≈øt, if po≈ø≈øible, to reduce them to regular Forms: but if the place will not permit it, take fir≈øt the Plot of the place, and ob≈øerve what Angles are made between every two ≈øides thereof.</p>
                           <p>Then look in the Table, in the cell of the Angles of <hi>Polygons,</hi> and ≈øee what <hi>Polygon</hi> the ob≈øerved Angle comes neere≈øt to, and make that Ba≈øtion according to the mea≈øures belonging to that <hi>Polygon,</hi> and ≈øo of the re≈øt; ≈øo ≈øhall you have unequal Ba≈øtions, but alike defen≈øible. Wherein likewi≈øe it is be noted, that if the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108706:142"/>
two ≈øides of your interior <hi>Polygon</hi> be of unequal length, the Ba≈øtion is be≈øt framed according to the mea≈øures taken upon the ≈øhorter ≈øide.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Example.</hi> Let it be required to draw Ba≈øtions to the ≈øide of an inordinate <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagon,</hi> who≈øe Angles are, as they are marked in the third Figure.</p>
                           <p>Fir≈øt, I ob≈øerve 134, the Angle comprehended between two of the ≈øides, comes neere≈øt to the Angle of an <hi>Octagon</hi> in the Cell of the Angles of <hi>Polygons;</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that Ba≈øtion is to be drawn according to the mea≈øures belonging to an <hi>Octagon,</hi> taking the mea≈øures from the ≈øhorte≈øt ≈øide <hi>A B.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now becau≈øe the mea≈øures of the <hi>Polygon</hi> interior belong to an <hi>Octagon,</hi> is 614, you mu≈øt make a Scale, of which 614 parts ≈øhall be equal to <hi>A B;</hi> then ≈øet off the Neck or Gorge <hi>A E, B E,</hi> 127 ≈øuch parts, as <hi>A B</hi> is 614; then mea≈øure 106 for the Wing. La≈øtly, becau≈øe the Center of the Figure is not known, by which the mea≈øure of the Capital line ≈øhould be taken, I take the Angle between the Wing prolonged and the Face, and take off 240 ≈øuch parts as the Curtain is 360, and ≈øo fini≈øh the Ba≈øtion belonging to the Angle 134</p>
                           <p>The next Angle 113, which is neere≈øt to a <hi>Hexagon,</hi> therefore that Ba≈øtion mu≈øt be framed from the ≈øhorter ≈øide, according to the mea≈øures of a <hi>Hexagon;</hi> and ≈øo mu≈øt all the Angles be fortified by tho≈øe mea≈øures which come neere≈øt to the Angle comprehended between the ≈øides thereof.</p>
                           <p>But in all Irregular Fortifications, much is attributed to the judgment of the Enginier, either to increa≈øe or dimini≈øh the Angles as he finds mo≈øt convenient, but in ≈øuch manner as the line of defence may ≈øcoure the face of the Ba≈øtion, and that one part thereof may defend, and be defended by the other.</p>
                           <p>It now remains to treat of the manner of making of Ditches about Forts, of the quantity of earth required to make a Fort, with Walls of any determined breadth and height; as al≈øo what inclinations they ought to have, both on the in≈øide and the out≈øide; within, of that ≈øloapne≈øs, that the Souldiers may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty) go up and down; but without, ≈øloaping ≈øo little, that they may not be ≈øcaled by the Enemy; yet ≈øo much, that the foundation may be ≈øtrong. But this I ≈øhall omit for the pre≈øent, my de≈øign not being to write here all nece≈ø≈øary to be known in this Art, but only ≈øo much as might enable the Ingenious Souldier to be able to fortifie any place in the ab≈øence or want of an Enginier.</p>

                     <p>BEfore you load your Piece, take care to clean≈øe the Touch-hole, and ≈øweep the Piece clean within with a dry Lanade or Spunge; then (ob≈øerving the Winde) ≈øet your Powder-barrel to weather your Piece, and your Lin≈øtock on the contrary. Then filling your Ladle, give it a gentle knock on the foot, that the loo≈øe Corns may ≈øhake off into the barrel; then put your Ladle into your Piece, and being come to the bottome of the bore, draw it back two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth, and turn it over; then take it out, and with your Rammer (you
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:108706:145"/>
≈øtanding on the right ≈øide of your Piece) ham the Powder clo≈øe into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Piece, another (in the mean time) holding the Finger or Thumb upon the Touch-hole, that the Powder may not fly out that way: If the Touch-hole be full, it is a ≈øure ≈øigh that the Powder is well rammed; and if your Piece be to be charged at twice, you mu≈øt do this after each Ladle-ful.</p>
                     <p>Then take a wi≈øp of Hey or Straw, and chru≈øt it hard into the mouth of the Piece after the Powder, that no loo≈øe Corns may remain in the empty part of the <hi>Cylinder,</hi> and ram that ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d home upon the Powder.</p>
                     <p>Then again, take a dry Lanade, and clean≈øe the <hi>Cylinder</hi> of the Piece, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oothing be left in the hollow <hi>Cylinder,</hi> to hinder the Bullets way.</p>
                     <p>This done, make your Bullet very clean, that neither Earth nor Sand hang upon it, and put it gently into your Piece, and after it a wad of Hey or Straw ea≈øily rammed.</p>
                     <p>And here note, that in doing this you mu≈øt not ≈øtand right before the mouth of your Piece, but on one ≈øide, for fear of mi≈øchances; and having charged your Piece, you mu≈øt lay your Ladle, Lanade, Scowrer and Rammer on the right ≈øide of your Piece, the Ladle and Lanade their heads towards the mouth, and the Rammer and Scowrer towards the Breech of the Piece.</p>
                     <p>Your Piece being thus charged, direct her to the intended Mark, and then Prime her; in the doing of which, Fir≈øt, with your Priming-iron enter the Touch-hole, and let your Powder come from the Touch-hole to the Ba≈øe-ring, for there you may fire ≈øafely; for if you fire at the Touch-hole, your Lin≈øtock may be forced out of your hand: therefore ≈øome u≈øe to prime their Gun two or three inches forward off the Touch-hole; for if that be large, the more care mu≈øt be had in firing.</p>
                     <p>In firing of any Piece, take your Lin≈øtock in your right hand, and coming to the ≈øide of your Piece, ≈øet forward one Leg, keep your Body upright, and your Arm extended at full length; the cole of your Match being cleared, give fire to the Powder, ≈øo ≈øhall you perform your work both ≈øafely and gracefully.</p>

                     <p>Fir≈øt, Take a ≈ømall ≈øtreight Stick or Wyer, and put it downright into the Touch-hole of your piece, and even with the top of the Metal of the ba≈øe-ring; this Stick taken out of the Touch-hole, apply to the bottom of the Metal, at the bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>A Shot is ≈øaid to be defective, when it is either over, under, or wide of the mark aimed at: to remedy this, you mu≈øt ob≈øerve the≈øe few Directions following:</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, If your Shot be right to your Mark, but yet over, it is a ≈øign your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpart is too ≈øhort, which you may remedy by placing a di≈øpart upon the muzzle-ring of ≈øuch a length, that looking by the ba≈øe-ring and the mark the ≈øhot la≈øt made, you may ≈øee the top of the di≈øpart: with this new di≈øpart level your piece to the mark, prime and give fire, and doubtle≈øs your ≈øhot will prove good.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If your Shot be ju≈øt under the mark, then look how much the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part is over the Mark of the Shot la≈øt made, and cut it ≈øo much ≈øhorter, that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the breech of the Piece, you ≈øee the mark of the la≈øt Shot, and the top of the di≈øpart in one right line; then by this di≈øpart level your Gun to the Mark, and give fire.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, But if your fir≈øt Shot had been level with, but yet to the right hand of the Mark; to remedy this, ≈øtand at the breech of the piece, looking over the di≈øpart at the mark the la≈øt Shot made, and upon that part of the ba≈øe-ring, which you then look over, ≈øet up a pin with a little wax; ≈øo this pin will be in a right line with the di≈øpart and Mark of the Shot: then level the piece again, by help of this pin and the di≈øpart, to your a≈ø≈øigned Mark, and without Que≈øtion you will make an effectual ≈øhot.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, But if your ≈øhot be both wide, and too high, or too low, then both the former rules mu≈øt be applied to regulate it, which rea≈øon will be≈øt direct how to perform.</p>
                     <p>And here note, that the≈øe defective Shots la≈øt ≈øpoken of, are not, or may not be in the fault of the Gunner; for let him di≈øpart and level his Gun never ≈øo well,
