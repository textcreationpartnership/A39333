            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> A diſcourſe of the <hi>Poſtures,</hi> and handling of <hi>Arms.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HE that will be a compleat Souldier, muſt firſt begin to learn the uſe of his <hi>Arms,</hi> laying that down in his thoughts for his firſt foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this hath been the neglect of many in our times, who have ſtrived to know high thoughts in the <hi>Art Military,</hi> before they can well perform their <hi>Poſtures.</hi> Therefore, my advice ſhall be unto all ſuch that deſire to thrive in this Art, that they will not <hi>ſoar</hi> too high: but firſt learn the <hi>A, B, C</hi> thereof, after which they may proceed by degrees to pronounce to the Souldier with boldneſs their proficiency therein. He therefore that with ſafety, eaſe, and delight deſireth to handle his Arms, muſt ſet times apart frequently to practiſe himſelf therein. And here I cannot but much blame the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of our <hi>Trained Bands in London,</hi> of two great neglects: The firſt, in making men <hi>File-leaders</hi> either out of reſpect or favour they bear unto them, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one man hath a better <hi>Buff-coat</hi> than another: I ſpeak not this to encourage any man to come ſlovenly habited when he ſhall march forth with his <hi>Captain,</hi> but rather adviſe all Souldiers to fit themſelves with the beſt array they can; and could wiſh all the <hi>Serjeants</hi> in drawing up their <hi>Files,</hi> to pitch upon ſuch Gentlemen to be <hi>File-leaders,</hi> as may take charge of his <hi>File,</hi> and ſhall be able, willing, and ready upon all convenient times, to inſtruct and teach his <hi>File</hi> in all their <hi>Poſtures,</hi> and neat handling of their <hi>Arms;</hi> which if carefully obſerved, they would reap the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of much eaſe to themſelves and the private Souldiers: readineſs in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the <hi>Poſtures,</hi> would much redound to the honour of the Captain that ſhall lead them. But for the farther ſatisfaction of the ingenious Souldier that ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what <hi>Poſture</hi> is, I ſhall briefly reſolve them thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Poſture,</hi> as I conceive, is a <hi>garbe</hi> or <hi>figure</hi> that a man ſtands in, in the handling of his <hi>Arms;</hi> which he uſeth for the better grace and becoming of them.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral motions belonging to each <hi>Poſture,</hi> which ſome call <hi>Poſtures,</hi> but they much deceive themſelves, as ſhall appear clearly unto them (by the ſurvey) as they ſhall be ſet down in order. And firſt, we will begin to ſet down the <hi>Poſtures</hi> of the <hi>Pike.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Several Reaſons why the <hi>Pike</hi> is the more honourable Arms.</head>
                     <p>FIrſt I ſhall begin to ſet down the <hi>poſtures</hi> of the <hi>Pike,</hi> before the <hi>poſtures</hi> of the <hi>Musket,</hi> for theſe reaſons following, as conceiving, Firſt, They are the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Arms,</hi> in reſpect the <hi>Colours</hi> flying upon the head of them, and upon the drawing up of the Company there is the moſt propereſt place for the <hi>Captain</hi> to be, either upon a Stand or upon a March, provided he have ground ſufficient to March them all abreſt. If upon a Stand the Captain ſhall have occaſion to engage againſt an Enemy, thither his Officers may repair unto him upon the head of the <hi>Pikes,</hi>
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:108706:4"/>
there to receive directions. And if the Captain ſhall cauſe the <hi>Serjeants</hi> to draw off part, or all the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> from the Body of <hi>Pikes</hi> to fire againſt the enemy, the Gentlemen of the <hi>Pikes</hi> in the mean time ſtand undauntedly to undergo the cruel ſhot of the Cannon from the contrary part for to preſerve their Colours, who are likewiſe a place of <hi>Randezvous</hi> for the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to repair unto when they ſhall retreat from fight. Farther, it hath been the ambition of many Gentlemen, both in <hi>Holland, France,</hi> and in theſe our late unhappy Wars in <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>trail Pikes</hi> with ſeveral Commanders whom they ſhall think fit. And laſtly, to conclude all, that the <hi>Pike</hi> is the more honourable <hi>Arms,</hi> it is ſo in reſpect of antiquity; for there hath been the uſe of the <hi>Pike</hi> and <hi>Spear,</hi> many hundred years before there was any knowledge of the <hi>Musket,</hi> as in many Hiſtories you ſhall find. And ſo for preſent I will conclude this diſcourſe of the <hi>Pike,</hi> deſiring the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to have a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cenſure of me: for I intend not by it to perſwade all Souldiers to the handling of the <hi>Pike,</hi> and none to be <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> for that cannot be; I ſhould rather adviſe all <hi>Captains</hi> that have occaſion to raiſe their Companies, to have two thirds of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers,</hi> and but one of <hi>Pikes:</hi> that is to ſay, if they ſhould have 18 <hi>Files,</hi> to cauſe twelve of them to carry <hi>Muskets,</hi> and the other ſix <hi>files Pikes.</hi> And in my judgment they ſhall perform the better ſervice unto any Nation where they ſhall be employ'd: and I ſhall farther deſire the Souldiers (eſpecially thoſe that be of <hi>low</hi> ſtature) to handle and take delight in the uſe of the <hi>Musket;</hi> for it is an exceeding great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him ſo to handle his <hi>Musket,</hi> as that he doth it with eaſe, and in a comely manner; and he that ſhall become expert therein, I have often obſerved this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to follow him, by the report of others; Such a one is a good <hi>Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi> and an able Souldier: concluding thereby, he that will take the pains to be a good <hi>Muskettier,</hi> certainly cannot be idle, but hath gained ſomething more to make him capable of ſuch praiſe. To conclude, I ſhall deſire the Gentlemen of the <hi>Pikes</hi> and the Gentlemen of the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to go hand in hand in love like dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and neither of them to envy each other; and in ſo doing, God will give a bleſſing to their undertakings. But now fearing I have dwelt too long upon this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>Arms,</hi> I ſhall next proceed to ſet down, firſt the <hi>poſtures</hi> of the <hi>Pike,</hi> then the <hi>poſtures</hi> of the <hi>Musket,</hi> with all the words of <hi>command</hi> tending to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; after collect them in order in a <hi>brief</hi> way, and then ſet forth unto you the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of <hi>number</hi> that the one <hi>Arms</hi> hath with the other in the <hi>poſtures,</hi> as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

This way of charging to the <hi>Horſe,</hi> I have ſet down, as being practiſed ſometimes amongſt us in our private Meetings; but I conceive it to be of little uſe to receive a deſperate charge of the <hi>Horſe,</hi> for by theſe charges the Souldiers are in ſo lame and weak a <hi>poſture,</hi> that the <hi>Horſe</hi> cannot chooſe if they come on with a full <hi>career,</hi> but beat the <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Pike-men</hi> down to the ground: Therefore in my opinion, the beſt way of oppoſing the <hi>Horſe-charge,</hi> is that which we learned of our ever-honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Captain, Major Henry Tillier,</hi> in the <hi>Military Garden;</hi> which was, <hi>Files</hi> cloſing to the midſt to their <hi>cloſeſt Order,</hi> inſomuch that there was not above half a foot <hi>interval</hi> of ground between <hi>File</hi> and <hi>File,</hi> the <hi>Pikes Porting,</hi> and after cloſing their <hi>Ranks</hi> forwards ſo cloſe, that they locked themſelves one within another, and then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108706:4"/>
charged on. Which in my judgment is ſo ſecure a way from <hi>routing,</hi> that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any Body of <hi>Horſe</hi> to enter therein: and farther, to my beſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, I never could meet with any Souldier that hath been a broad upon any ſervice, that ever ſaw any charging of the <hi>Pikes</hi> at the <hi>Foot;</hi> therefore I will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceed.</p>

Now if you begin to be weary in the <hi>march,</hi> by reaſon of the weight of the <hi>musket,</hi> you may to eaſe your ſelf, bring your right hand backward, and there take hold of the <hi>musket,</hi> keeping ſtill your left hand in its firſt place, until you ſhall reduce him to the Reſt again.</p>

                     <p>THe Souldier now having obtained ſome pretty knowledge, skill, and ready aptneſs in the managing and performing the <hi>poſtures,</hi> begins to look about himſelf what next is needful for to faſten upon, to make a further progreſs in this Art; and ſtraight he meets with ſome that whiſpers to him, That it were a gallant thing to know the <hi>Dignity</hi> of a <hi>File</hi> true and rightly ſtated: To which he anſwers, But where can it be found? the opinions of ſouldiers are ſo various and differing therein, that none knows where for to attain it. My Captains eye (ſaith he) is upon me, becauſe I do the <hi>poſtures</hi> well, which cauſeth the Serjeants to make me a <hi>File-leader,</hi> and that I know to be the chiefeſt and firſt place of Honour in the File; the ſecond place to be the <hi>bringer-up;</hi> the third, the <hi>half-file-leader;</hi> the fourth, the <hi>bringer-up</hi> of the <hi>Front half-files.</hi> Thus far, no ſouldier of any known judgment can deny: but now a-dayes our Files being drawn up ſix deep, makes me altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ignorant of the honour of the reſt; neither know I the Dignity of a File eight or ten deep, which ſtill in ſome places they do retain, drawing them up ſo deep. If my ambition were but now fully ſatisfied herein, I ſhould in time come for to know the Dignity of the Captains, as they are drawn up all in a Regiment; by which Rule I am informed they walk. And in my judgment, there cannot be a truer ſtating the Dignity of a Rank and File, then that which ſhall conform to the Dignities of the Captains, as they are drawn up abreſt all in a Regiment. Now for as much as many Regiments conſiſt of ſeveral numbers of Captains, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies in them; as ſome ſix Companies, others eight; ſome greater, as ten, and twelve Companies: It is expedient therefore, not only for my ſelf, but for every ſouldier that will be truly knowing, to be reſolved herein concerning thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral numbers; and as occaſion ſhall alter to any other, they may inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by theſe how to fit their purpoſe. And therefore not to keep the apt and forward ſouldier longer in ſuſpence, but that he may proceed, I ſhall amongſt the reſt, declare my thoughts therein, and ſet it forth unto their view, ever ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from my fellow-ſouldiers a favourable cenſure of my good meaning to them and to my Country, for to imploy that little talent which lately my endeavours have obtained to do them ſervice: And ſhall forthwith ſet down unto them four Tables of Dignity, both of <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files,</hi> which ſhall be firſt of twelve abreſt, and twelve deep. Secondly, ten abreſt, and ten deep. Thirdly, eight abreſt, and eight deep. And laſtly, ſix abreſt, and ſix deep: wherein every ingenious ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier ſhall eaſily know his particular place of Honour and Dignity, both in <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>File,</hi> wherein he ſtands.</p>

                     <p>THat which gives moſt life for the true explaining of the former Table is, to ſhew the ſeveral places of Honour and Dignity of the Captains, how they are drawn up abreſt all in a Regiment. Be pleaſed therefore to go along with me, and you ſhall underſtand that the <hi>Colonel</hi> hath the firſt place of honour, as being Commander in chief, whoſe Company ſtands upon the right, which makes the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure (1). The ſecond place of honour in the Regiment is the <hi>Lieutenant-Colonel,</hi> whoſe Company is drawn up upon the left, as being the outmoſt there, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108706:7"/>
by the figure (2). The third place of honour is the <hi>Majors</hi> Company, which is drawn up upon the right of the left <hi>half Ranks,</hi> whoſe place is deſcribed by the figure (3). The fourth place of honour is the eldeſt <hi>Captains</hi> Company, which is drawn up upon the left of the right <hi>half Ranks,</hi> and is ſet forth by the figure (4). And now we have proceeded thus far, we will make <hi>Alt,</hi> and begin to examine whether we have rightly hitherto proceeded, or no; therefore, for the more cleering and underſtanding herein, you muſt take notice, it is the diſcretion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very knowing Commander, ſo to aim and ſtate his Battail, as that he makes his Front equivalent in worth, ſtrength, and dignity to that of the Reer, and with equal proportion of number; and in like manner ſo to order his right <hi>half Ranks,</hi> as that they may carry an equal ballance in worth, number and dignity with the left <hi>half Ranks.</hi> Now therefore to begin to make ſome trial or experiment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by examining the firſt worth with the fourth, and that will make the number (5) and then put to trial the ſecond worth and third, and you ſhall eaſily diſcern it to carry the ſame proportion of number. So that it may appear cleerly in the judgment of any diſcreet ſouldier a true and equal proportion, the Front with the Reer, the right <hi>half Ranks</hi> ſutable to the left <hi>half Ranks,</hi> and that both in number, honour, and dignity.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far entred into the diſcourſe, it remains to deſcribe and ſhew the reaſons of the other four of their places and dignity as they ſtand.</p>

                     <p>NOw for the further reſolution herein, there is to be taken notice of, That the general drawing up of Regiments, when they conſiſt of ſo few Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as 8, 6, or 7, is commonly in two grand Diviſions, that is to ſay, two bodies or two ſtands of <hi>Pikes</hi> which are flanked with <hi>Muskettiers.</hi> Therefore you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the diſcretion of the <hi>Major,</hi> who commonly is appointed to draw up the Regiments, doth ſo order the places of the <hi>Captains,</hi> that they may aptly fall into their due places of honour, upon a <hi>ſtand</hi> and upon a <hi>march;</hi> and doth ſo order their dignities as before is expreſt, as to make both the Front, Reer, right and left <hi>half Ranks</hi> equal in number, ſtrength, and dignity. And therefore he draws up the third and fourth Captain between the <hi>Colonels</hi> Company and the eldeſt <hi>Captain,</hi> which makes their number (13) and in like manner he draws the ſecond <hi>Captain</hi> and the youngeſt <hi>Captain</hi> between the <hi>Lieutenant-Colonels</hi> Company and the <hi>Majors,</hi> whoſe number likewiſe carries equal proportion to be (13). Now if you pleaſe to examine the whole number of the right <hi>half Ranks,</hi> and that makes (18) make trial likewiſe of the left <hi>half Ranks,</hi> in caſting up of his accompt, and you ſhall find the ſame proportion of number as is clearly ſet forth within the Table, both of <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files;</hi> for as the honour of every ſouldier ſtands in the <hi>Rank,</hi> you will find the ſame to ſtand ſo in the <hi>File.</hi>

                     <p>TO give you farther ſatisfaction, and Reaſons for the placing of the ſecond four, in reſpect it is contrary to the Rule and Judgment of ſome Souldiers, therefore farther obſerve with me this, When a Regiment is drawn up in the true Order of a Regimental way, there, is as before expreſſed, two bodies, or <hi>ſtands</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> flanked with <hi>Muskettiers;</hi> and it is the Office of every <hi>Major</hi> to give forth in writing notes of paper unto every <hi>Captain,</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> where their place ſhall be upon a <hi>Stand,</hi> and where upon a <hi>March,</hi> that he may with more readineſs know where to lead, and where to fall in, or to bring up, as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Now, for as much that it hath been the practice here in <hi>England,</hi> and in moſt Countries alſo beſides, as I have been informed by very able knowing ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that the firſt place of honour that is appointed out unto the Captains, is firſt unto the eldeſt, who alwayes leads the Colonels Colours, or firſt grand Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which is the greateſt honour that can be appointed out unto the Captains, and therefore moſt propereſt and due to him as being eldeſt: If ſo, as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108706:8"/>
that it is then generally granted, that the leading of the Colonels Colours, or the firſt <hi>body</hi> or <hi>ſtand</hi> of <hi>Pikes</hi> in the Colonels grand Diviſion, is the firſt and chiefeſt place of honour amongſt the Captains; why then, certainly, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the ſecond Captain, which carries the number (5) would be infinitely wronged and injured, if he were denied, and not brought into the left <hi>half Ranks,</hi> for there he aptly ſtands to fall in, to lead the Lieutenant-Colonels Colours, or the ſecond <hi>body</hi> or <hi>ſtand</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which is the ſecond place of honour. Now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſolved, that it is cleerly the due and right for the ſecond Captains place, to lead the ſecond body of <hi>Pikes;</hi> we muſt then of neceſſity bring in the youngeſt Captain into the left <hi>half Ranks</hi> likewiſe, who carries the number (8) and that will make up an equal proportion, as before expreſt, to the third and fourth <hi>Captains,</hi> carrying with them the figures (6 and 7) which are drawn up in the right <hi>half rank.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Reaſons given for the laſt Table of every particular Place of Honour and Dignity, as they ſtand.</head>
                     <p>I Conceive what formerly hath been expreſt of the middle Table, may give full reſolution of the particular places of Honour and Dignity as they ſtand both in <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>File.</hi> It further now remains to ſpeak ſomewhat of the reſt, and therefore I ſhall go downward, cleering ſtill the firſt four places of honour; which being rightly underſtood, the reſt will naturally fall into the capacity of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious ſouldier. Therefore further pray obſerve with me this again in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſutableneſs and equal proportion of worth and number of the firſt and fourth worth, carrying unto that of the ſecond and third. And thus far you may reſt, and ſatisfie your ſelf therein. We have therefore now no more to place and ſettle, but the fifth and ſixth worth, and then our work in this Table will be quickly finiſhed. Therefore of neceſſity, as formerly expreſſed, we muſt bring in the fifth worth into the left <hi>half Ranks,</hi> as being the ſecond Captain, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, as I ſaid before, is to lead the Lieutenant-Colonels Colours, or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>body</hi> or <hi>ſtand</hi> of <hi>Pikes.</hi> He being there thus fixed, we have no more to place but the ſixth worth, which is the laſt, or youngeſt Captain; and we have no other place to bring him in, but between the firſt and fourth worth; or if you will have it more cleer, between the <hi>Colonel</hi> and eldeſt <hi>Captain.</hi> But, here by the way, I am like to meet with ſome Objector that will ſay, Sir, What's become of your equal proportion here? Your right <hi>half Ranks,</hi> with your left, as you have ſo formerly ſtated them; your right <hi>half Ranks</hi> carrieth or exceedeth one more in number then your left <hi>half Ranks</hi> doth; and where we find the greater number, we muſt conclude the leſſer dignity; and if ſo, Why do you not rather contrive it on the left, then upon the right? To which I anſwer, firſt, That in raiſing up of Companies into a Regiment, thoſe that are the <hi>Field</hi>-Officers by right ſhould have the moſt men, and greater Companies, then the private Captains have: therefore if you will obſerve in the ſtating of this Dignity of a Rank ſix abreſt, you will find in the left half Rank two <hi>Field</hi>-Officers, whoſe Companies are the greater then any <hi>private</hi> Captains; certainly, they muſt needs countervail with any number of men with the right half Ranks; for although the <hi>Colonels</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is, or ought ever to be the greateſt, yet there is no more <hi>Field</hi>-Officers, but himſelf in his Diviſion. And again, ſecondly, where there cannot be an equal dividing of number (as here you will find it of ſix abreſt, or ſix deep) but that there will fall out ſome odd, either on the right half Ranks, or on the left; and likewiſe the ſame either in the Front half files, or Reer half files, as by example in the trial you will eaſily find, by caſting up the whole number as they ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſt, and they will fall out to be (21) divide this number into two parts, and you cannot but muſt caſt the odd either on the right or on the left: Therefore to conclude, ſince that there is a great poſſibility that there will be an equality of number of men in the left half Ranks ſutable to that of the right, where there ſhall fall out an odd number, that you cannot caſt it into the left half Ranks, but that you muſt remove the fifth worth; in this extremity I ſay you may not do it,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108706:8"/>
but rather place it on the right. For the <hi>Major</hi> having no certain place to <hi>march</hi> in a <hi>Regiment,</hi> it is the proper place of the <hi>ſecond Captain</hi> to walk along with the <hi>Lieutenant-Colonel,</hi> taking his due place of honour in his Diviſion, as the <hi>first</hi> ſhall do by marching with his <hi>Colonel;</hi> And thus much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken of the laſt Table.</p>

                     <p>Thus much, I conceive, may give a right underſtanding to any coming-on Souldier of the true and right ſtating of a <hi>Rank</hi> twelve abreſt, being a thing very needful for to know, in reſpect that there are many Regiments which do conſiſt of twelve Companies; and when in courſe, as in the ſequel of this Book, when as I ſhall ſhew the manner of drawing up of twelve Companies; there will a little more light appear unto them to their farther knowledge of the ſame. But thus much for the preſent, as concerning a <hi>Rank</hi> twelve abreſt: And now I ſhall come to ſpeak or to touch a little of a <hi>Rank</hi> ten abreſt, and a <hi>File</hi> ten deep.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus now paſſed over ſeveral reaſons, and with as much brevity as I could, to ſatisfie the longing deſire of the young ſouldiers requeſt of every particular place of honour as they ſtand in dignity both in Rank and File; which being paſſed over, the next will follow by courſe, before we come to joyn the <hi>Files</hi> into a <hi>Body,</hi> to ſatisfie the ſouldier of each particular <hi>Diſtance,</hi> with the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſons and uſes of the ſame: for next to the <hi>Poſtures</hi> it is the firſt thing or part of the <hi>Military exerciſe,</hi> and moſt neceſſary for the ſouldier to be knowing in. Yet I muſt confeſs no <hi>Commander</hi> is ſo tied up or limited in the <hi>exerciſing</hi> of his men at all times to begin with <hi>Distances</hi> firſt, ſo as to ſhew them all through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; but nevertheleſs, in all and every one of the <hi>motions</hi> in the exerciſing of a <hi>Body,</hi> care muſt be taken that the ſouldier have his proper <hi>diſtance</hi> for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſame. Neither can any <hi>Leader</hi> exerciſe his men, but firſt he muſt command them to ſome <hi>diſtance</hi> ſutable to what he will begin. As ſome I have ſeen begin their <hi>exerciſes</hi> with <hi>Facings,</hi> ſome other with <hi>Doublings,</hi> others with <hi>Counter-marches</hi> and with <hi>Wheelings.</hi> Yet nevertheleſs, whoever they be that will ſo begin, as I ſaid before, muſt command his ſouldiers to ſome <hi>Diſtance,</hi> which may be proper for the ſame.

                     <p>The <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files</hi> being thus opened unto their <hi>twice double Diſtance</hi> from their <hi>cloſest Order,</hi> I conceive it to be a more ſouldierly-like way in the <hi>Opening</hi> and <hi>Cloſing</hi> of <hi>Files,</hi> that the diſcretion of the <hi>Commander</hi> do vary, and alter the hand in the commanding of them, then alwayes from every <hi>Diſtance</hi> to tie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to any particular hand; as to <hi>open to the right,</hi> and <hi>cloſe to the right.</hi> But as concerning the opening of <hi>Ranks,</hi> the propereſt way in my judgment is to open them alwayes to the <hi>Reer,</hi> in reſpect it is performed with more facility: For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Rank</hi> from the firſt takes his due <hi>Diſtance</hi> as he is commanded, without any further trouble, or to a half-facing to the <hi>right,</hi> by taking it from the <hi>Reer,</hi> if from that place they ſhall be opened; and ſo likewiſe it were a great deal better in the <hi>cloſing of Ranks,</hi> to cloſe them forwards, in reſpect it is for the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of their cloſing, then to the <hi>Reer.</hi> For then, again, they muſt perform a half-<hi>facing,</hi> which is not only unhandſome, but troubleſome to the ſouldier. All that can be ſaid to maintain it, (as I conceive, in opening <hi>Ranks</hi> forwards) is becauſe they have not room in the <hi>Reer;</hi> which ſeldome happens ſo in any <hi>exerciſe,</hi> if diſcreetly <hi>ordered</hi> by him that leads them. As for <hi>cloſing of the Ranks backwards,</hi> I cannot conceive any ſolid reaſons to confirm the ſame, and therefore will paſs over it, and come to cloſe our <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files</hi> to ſuch <hi>Diſtance,</hi> from whence they firſt were opened.</p>

themſelves ſo firm and ſtedfaſt, one within another, which 'twere impoſſible for any <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Horſe</hi> to enter in amongſt them. Secondly, it is of excellent uſe for to maintain a <hi>breach,</hi> and to keep out an enemy. Thirdly, it is very uſeful to both Arms, at ſuch time when a Commander hath any thing of conſequence to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto his Company, which he may have many occaſions ſo to do; as before his Exerciſe, to adviſe them to ſilence, to obſerve their words of command, and their directions; and when they are to fight againſt an Enemy, to perſwade and keep them off from fear, by aſſuring them good reaſons of hopes of overcoming. Theſe, or ſuch-like ſpeeches, many times a <hi>Captain</hi> may have juſt occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf unto his Company; and being at ſo cloſe a <hi>Diſtance,</hi> they may more aptly hear his words, and obey his Commands. But here now by the way, too much preaching upon the head of a Company concerning matters of Exerciſe, is too much a dulling of the ſouldier, who rather would fall into action, then ſo to be confounded with much talking.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cloſe Order</hi> may be of very good uſe alſo for moſt things which have been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the <hi>cloſeſt Order;</hi> only here the ſouldier hath a little more liberty in the handling of his arms by being at a wider <hi>diſtance.</hi> This <hi>diſtance</hi> alſo is of good uſe, before <hi>wheelings,</hi> becauſe many times upon their moving, they are apt to flie out to their proper <hi>diſtance</hi> of <hi>Order,</hi> which they alwayes ſhould be at in their <hi>wheelings;</hi> where note, if firſt they were at <hi>Order,</hi> they would flie out to wider <hi>diſtance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Order</hi> is the <hi>diſtance</hi> which the ſouldier doth fight upon, and is to be uſed skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing againſt an enemy; it is alſo uſeful at ſuch a time, when the <hi>Drum</hi> ſhall beat a <hi>Troop,</hi> and that the ſouldiers are marching to relieve ſome <hi>Court of Guard,</hi> or making ſome expedition againſt an enemy, for then they are in a fit capacity of <hi>diſtance</hi> for to fight. It is alſo very uſeful, and to be obſerved upon <hi>facings,</hi> for all <hi>intire doublings,</hi> and for <hi>wheelings; Order</hi> likewiſe in <hi>File,</hi> and <hi>open Order</hi> in <hi>Rank,</hi> is to be uſed at ſuch time when the <hi>Drum</hi> ſhall beat a <hi>March,</hi> and the Body upon the moving or marching.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Open Order</hi> is the <hi>diſtance</hi> proper for all <hi>doublings</hi> of <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files,</hi> by the <hi>half-files</hi> or by the <hi>bringers-up,</hi> wherein they have <hi>interval</hi> of ground ſufficient to move in. It is alſo a very proper <hi>diſtance</hi> for <hi>facings,</hi> and ever to be obſerved in time of <hi>Counter-marches.</hi> It is the propereſt <hi>diſtance</hi> for the <hi>Ranks</hi> to be in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>march,</hi> but the <hi>Files</hi> are then to be at <hi>Order,</hi> as is before expreſt.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of <hi>double Diſtance</hi> is to be obſerved at ſuch times when the ſouldiers ſhall ſtand, or happen to be in ſome eminent danger of the <hi>Cannon-ſhot</hi> from the Enemy; for ſtanding then ſo <hi>thin,</hi> they may be much preſerved from danger: it is likewiſe very good for <hi>Inverſion,</hi> and <hi>Converſion.</hi>

                     <p>You may take notice of theſe brief directions, in openings of <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files;</hi> when the <hi>Files</hi> are commanded to <hi>Open to the right,</hi> the left-hand <hi>File</hi> ſtands, and all the <hi>Files</hi> take their <hi>diſtance</hi> from the <hi>left;</hi> obſerving alwayes in the motions of <hi>Files,</hi> their <hi>Leaders,</hi> and to move altogether along with them. If it be an <hi>opening of Files to the left,</hi> then contrary-wiſe the right-hand <hi>File</hi> ſtands, and they take their <hi>diſtance</hi> from the <hi>right.</hi> So likewiſe for <hi>cloſings</hi> unto what hand ſoever they be commanded to <hi>cloſe,</hi> the out-moſt <hi>File</hi> is to ſtand, the reſt are to move and <hi>cloſe</hi> to that. In <hi>opening</hi> or <hi>cloſing</hi> of <hi>Ranks,</hi> the firſt <hi>Rank</hi> is alwayes to ſtand, the reſt are to move either <hi>opening</hi> or <hi>cloſing,</hi> according as is commanded; alwayes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in their motions their right-hand-men, and moving altogether.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108706:10"/>
of every Officer under his Command, punctually at that hour and place, thither to repair, for the more incouraging of the ſouldiers as they ſhall come in, and not to ſtir themſelves from thence, without ſome order from their <hi>Captain,</hi> for fear of giving bad examples unto others. And when they ſhall perceive ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of men to come in, the <hi>Serjeants</hi> then may take advice with their <hi>Lieutenant</hi> and <hi>Enſign,</hi> which of them they will appoint out to draw forth the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and which the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and whom they ſhall make the right-hand <hi>File-leader</hi> of the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and who ſhall be the left; and again, who ſhall be the <hi>leader</hi> of the right-hand <hi>File</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> and who ſhall be the left: For theſe four, being ſuch remarkable places of Honour unto the knowing ſouldier, that ſpecial care muſt be had in placing deſerving men to be there. Now it is, or ought to be the diſcretion of every <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> and <hi>Enſign,</hi> (as being <hi>Commiſſion-Officers</hi>) to reſolve the <hi>Serjeants</hi> herein, that they may with more alacrity go on to draw the reſt up between; and ſo to order unto each of them their particular duties, as to carry equal pains in drawing forth the <hi>Files.</hi> Therefore in reſpect that for the moſt part in every Company, they have three <hi>Serjeants,</hi> two of them ought to take charge in drawing forth the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> (being helpt by the advice of their <hi>Lieutenant,</hi>) and the other to draw forth the <hi>Files</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> being aſſiſted in counſel by their <hi>Enſign:</hi> for at ſuch times the <hi>Officers</hi> ought not to be idle, and to ſtand gazing upon each other; but every one, according to his particular place and relation, ſhould be very active and aſſiſting to each other. In the drawing up the Company, the propereſt way will be then, as you may underſtand, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting up a Company, to draw them forth into <hi>Files,</hi> and to make them fix deep; as being our cuſtome here in <hi>England:</hi> and farther to have care in chooſing able ſouldiers to be <hi>File-leaders,</hi> who having ſpent ſome time and pains in their <hi>Files</hi> in ſhewing them their <hi>Poſtures,</hi> they may be called to joyn into a <hi>body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For farther direction herein unto the <hi>Serjeants</hi> (whoſe proper place it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto) to obſerve this order in drawing up their <hi>Files,</hi> that they may ingroſſe the <hi>Pikes</hi> into one <hi>body</hi> by themſelves, and the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> into another, and not to flank the <hi>Pikes</hi> until ſuch time they ſhall perceive that in both Arms they are compleat: There are likewiſe ſeveral places of honour that the <hi>Serjeants</hi> ought to take notice of, and to be informed of placing of men of worth and deſert in both Arms, that is to ſay, in the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> and of the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath by figures I ſhall ſet forth for farther ſatisfaction therein.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <figDesc>formation</figDesc>
                     </figure>
                     <p>Here I have ſet down the manner how the Serjeants ſhould draw up their Files in each Arms apart by themſelves, and have figured forth unto them the four chief places of honour in both Arms. It concerns them therefore very much to mind and have regard to theſe particular places, and to order ſuch men of worth there, which may be well deſerving of the ſame; and thoſe Gentlemen whom they ſhall think fit after to be worthy of File-leaders places, they are to draw them up between the figure (1) and the figure (4), and between the figure (3) and the figure (2) and that Rule to obſerve in both Arms; and to be careful to place good ſouldiers in the Reer, and ſuch who may be able ſouldiers for half-File-leaders, becauſe there may be much occaſion by Doublings to bring them up for to aſſiſt the Front.</p>
                     <p>Thus much, I do confeſs, may be ſufficient for the preſent to give directions to the <hi>Serjeants</hi> for the drawing up the Files, and joyning them together. Next, after I have ſhewn how to flank their <hi>Pikes</hi> with <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> I will ſet forth unto

them and the <hi>Drums,</hi> where their places are upon a <hi>ſtand,</hi> and where to be put upon a <hi>march.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Several reaſons given for the placing of the <hi>Serjeants</hi> after this manner.</head>
                     <p>WHen a Body is drawn up in manner as before expreſſed; the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> being Commander in chief, his diſcretion is to ballance the Officers as near as he can with equal dignity and worth, his <hi>Front</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally with the <hi>Reer.</hi> To which purpoſe he takes unto himſelf the youngeſt <hi>Serjeant,</hi> and places him on the right <hi>Angle</hi> in the <hi>Front,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be there ready to march down into the Body or elſewhere, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the diſcretion of the <hi>Captain,</hi> to fulfil his commands; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſtand there as a ſpectator of the <hi>Captains</hi> actions, and an aſſiſtant, which may be much improvement to him. And in like manner he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108706:11"/>
the third Serjeant to the left Angle in the Reer; as being the ſecond youngeſt, and may be a help unto his Lieutenant there, as the fourth is to him in the Front. The eldeſt Serjeant he orders to the left Angle in the Front, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt honourable place for him, being there ready to lead upon a march the Van of the Reer-Guard; and the ſecond Serjeant he is appointed to ſtand on the right Angle of the Reer, to make them equal in dignity unto the Front. Now if you pleaſe to examine the dignity of the Serjeants in the firſt place, as the firſt Serjeant and the fourth, making the number (5) and after take a view of the ſecond place, or Reer, and there you ſhall obſerve that the ſecond Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and third, may every way ballance themſelves, to be equivalent in the worth with the firſt and fourth, carrying with them alike the ſame number. So that it is clearly evident, that the Serjeants are rightly ſtated in number and dignity, the Front proportionably with the Reer, in the judgement of any knowing Souldier. Something more may be ſpoken of the ſecond Serjeants place, which you may take notice in his march, to lead the ſecond Diviſion of Pikes, which is the moſt honourableſt place of leading that is appointed forth unto the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, the firſt only excepted; and upon a ſtand, when they ſhall lead up their Diviſions, every Serjeant is to betake him unto his place, as they were at firſt placed, and to continue there until ſuch time they ſhall receive further order from their Captain. Thus much, I conceive, may give ſatisfaction unto the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Souldier in theſe particulars, leaving them liberty to judge according unto their own beſt thoughts, while we endeavour to draw up our Diviſions all abreſt again, and to make ſome deſcription of a Body.</p>
                     <p>The Captain upon his March having attained ſome convenient place to draw up his Company, makes Alt, and commands the Serjeants to lead up their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the left, and cauſes the Muskettiers to open from the Pikes, making ſufficient intervals for the Drums, to beat two abreſt, even with the Front, the firſt two between the right-hand-File-leader of Pikes, and the Muskettiers upon the right; the ſecond two Drums doing the like upon the left. And always the Captain ought to march his company after this manner all abreſt, provided he have ground ſufficient for the ſame. And being far more graceful ſo to do, then to march them ſtragling upon a long march, for it doth repreſent in ſome kind the manner of marching of a Regiment; and at ſuch times the Serjeants are to march upon the Angles, as is before deſcribed, moving to and again ſometimes upon the Flanks, and cauſing the Souldiers to keep their Diſtance of order in File, and open order in Rank, and to march all even abreſt, and after to return again unto their places.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Before I come to make deſcription of a Body, I ſhall ſhew ſome further Reaſons of the Serjeants places of leſſer Companies, with the placing of the Drums.</head>
                     <p>IT happens many times ſome Companies falls not out ſo large, as is before ſet forth, and that they have but three Serjeants, and therefore it would be known, when that they have but one Diviſion of Muskettiers in the Van, two Diviſions of Pikes, and one Diviſion of Muskettiers in the Reer, which is the Reer-Guard, where then the placing of theſe three Serjeants, and three Drums ſhall be upon their long March, and where to be marching all abreſt. To which, I anſwer, in the firſt place, the youngeſt Serjeant is always to attend the Captain, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Diviſion to lead, he is to be upon the right Angle of the Front, there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his Captains pleaſure and commands; and the ſecond Serjeant is to lead the ſecond Diviſion of Pikes, and the eldeſt Serjeant to lead the laſt Diviſion of Muskettiers, or the Reer-Guard: here are their places upon the long march.</p>
                     <p>But when they are drawn up, and ſo march even abreſt, the youngeſt Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants place, as is before expreſt, is to march upon the right Angle in the Front, and the eldeſt upon the left, the ſecond Serjeant is to march in the right Angle in the Reer. They having their places thus ſtated, are to move ſometimes up and down upon the Flanks in their marching, cauſing the Souldiers to keep their due diſtance of order in File, and open order in Rank, and to march even abreſt, and after they may return to their places again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:108706:12"/>But here, methinks, I meet with ſome Objector by the way, who ſaith, the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt is much wronged herein; for that it is his proper place to be upon the right; that when Forlorns are drawn off againſt an Enemy, he is there ready firſt to lead them on, claiming it as his due to give the firſt on ſet, and therefore far more honour for him to be on the right then on the left, and the eldeſt Serjeant ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther placed on the left then on the right. As for the ſecond Serjeants place, 'tis fit he ſhould be in the Reer, to aſſiſt the Lieutenant there, he having none but he to help him, if any occaſion ſhould require. To which I anſwer, that it is the youngeſt Serjeants place to be upon the right Angle, either upon a Stand, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a March, and not the eldeſt, for theſe reaſons following. The youngeſt Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant is not placed there for any honour that it is to him, for he hath no Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all to lead upon the March (except the Company be very great) and if ſo, he is placed ſo near the Captain, to be ſerviceable to him, to carry and convey his pleaſures unto all the reſt of the Officers. As for the leading of the Van-guard upon the March, the Captain takes that place unto himſelf; and it is far more honour unto the eldeſt Serjeant to be a Leader of the Reer-guard, or entirely the left Flank, then to lead a Subdiviſion of Pikes. And beſides that, it is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for his place to be upon the left, when they are all drawn up upon a breſt, for theſe two reaſons; as firſt, he is thereupon in readineſs to take his due place, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſub-dividing on the long March; and again, upon a Stand, when they are all drawn up, and ready to engage againſt an Enemy, and the Forlorns to be drawn forth, equally alike from both Flanks, he is then as ready in the Front to execute his Captains Commands, the youngeſt Serjeant being likewiſe ſent to be ſomething helpful to him, and attending after for further order from his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to ſend him relief by the ſecond Serjeant, as occaſion ſhall require. So that in my judgement, take it either upon the long March, or otherwiſe, when drawn all up even abreſt, all things are ſo ſtated, for his due honour and place, that he hath no reaſon to complain, nor any of the reſt, having all their due and proper places which doth belong unto them.</p>
                     <p>As for the placing of the Drums upon the long March, every Diviſion ought to have his Drums fall between ſuch Ranks as before expreſt; excepting only the ſecond Diviſion of Pikes, which may be excuſed, when they are to beat a March, as being all drawn up, they are to fall in two, to beat even abreſt upon the right, and one upon the left, as is before ſet down. If it ſhould chance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Company, to be ſo ſmall to have but three Diviſions, that is to ſay, one Diviſion of Muskettiers in the Van, the Body of Pikes in the midſt, and another Diviſion of Muskettiers to bring up the Reer-guard, and having but two Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and two Drums; the youngeſt Serjeants place will be as before mentioned, upon the right in the Front, and the eldeſt Serjeant upon the left, and to take his place to lead the laſt Diviſion of Muskettiers upon the long March; and the firſt Drum to beat in the firſt Diviſion of Muskettiers, and the ſecond to beat and to march along amongſt the Pikes. I have a little more enlarged my ſelf in this Diſcourſe of placing of the Serjeants, then I at firſt intended; but meeting many times with ſeveral Souldiers, deſiring ſatisfaction in every one of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I ſhall perhaps undergo here the hard cenſure of ſome, for this my tedious Diſcourſe; but ſuch others which deſire to be knowing herein, I hope they will have a more favourable opinion of my good meaning unto them. And here I ſhall conclude for the preſent, concerning the particular places of the Serjeants in every private Company; and now ſuppoſing, as by order from the Captain, the Serjeants have brought up their Diviſions, ſtanding again, as before, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſomething more to be ſpoken unto them, they ſilently ſtand to hear what follows.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> A Deſcription of a Body of men throughout, with all their ſeveral parts and kinds.</head>
                     <p>IT is very neceſſary knowledge to every particular Souldier, to be acquainted throughout with all the parts of a Body of men drawn up, with their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral extents and bounds, and with the true underſtanding of the ſame.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108706:12"/>
Where firſt note the Deſcription of Files; a File is a Sequence of men, conſiſting of Leaders and Followers, from the firſt unto the laſt; the joyning of Files flank-wiſe maketh Ranks, and is the compleating up of a Body: for one File alone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to have any Ranks in it, but joyning two or more Files together unto one, you may account them (provided they be ſix deep) to have ſo many Ranks for number, as doth extend from their Leaders to their Bringers-up. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know, that a Rank is a Row of men, ſtanding ſhoulder to ſhoulder, in an even line from the left Flank to the right; or from the outmoſt man upon the left, unto the outmoſt man upon the right; ſtanding all in a row File-wiſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be ſaid of one Rank, to have any Files in it; for as the cloſing of Files to Files, makes Ranks; ſo the adding of Ranks to Ranks, makes Files.</p>
                     <p>As for the Depth of Files, they have in theſe latter Ages much varied therein; ſometimes making them ſixteen deep, others ten, and eight deep, and now late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they have brought them unto ſix deep, as being the cuſtom of the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> and altogether now the practice here in <hi>England.</hi> In which form and way, I purpoſe to walk. But to proceed to my former promiſe to the Souldier: There is in every Body of men drawn up, conſiſting of Pikes and Muskettiers, whether of greater or ſmaller number, it makes no matter; <hi>A Front,</hi> a <hi>Reer,</hi> a <hi>Right-flank,</hi> and a <hi>Left-flank;</hi> there is alſo <hi>Front-half-files,</hi> and <hi>Reer-half-files;</hi> there is a <hi>Right-half-ranks,</hi> and a <hi>Left-half-ranks;</hi> and there is a <hi>Length</hi> and <hi>Depth</hi> of the Battail: and of every one of theſe in their ſeveral kinds. They have their particular extents and bounds, according to their number of men.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, take notice in the firſt place, that the Front is the firſt Rank, or Row of men, which are the File-leaders, and chief men of their Files, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ought to take charge of their Files, being as it were their Captains, and leads them firſt on in the Brunt againſt a furious Enemy. The extent of the Front is from the left-hand File-leader, unto the Leader of the right-hand File.</p>
                     <p>The Reer is the laſt Row or Rank of men, being the Bringers-up of the Files, who next the Leaders are the chiefeſt men of honour in the File, and are as it were unto them, their Lieutenants; and in the abſence of their Leaders, they are to take charge of the File, and to inſtruct them in their poſtures: the extent of the Reer, is from the Bringer-up of the left-hand File, unto the place of the Bringer-up of the right.</p>
                     <p>The right Flank is the outmoſt File upon the right, where always ought, by the way, to be very able Souldiers placed, becauſe they firſt give onſet, or fire againſt the Enemy, if on that part they ſhall be charged; the extent of the right Flank is from the Leader of the right-hand File, unto the Bringer-up of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The left Flank likewiſe is the outmoſt File upon the left, and his extent is from the Leader of the left-hand File, unto the Bringer-up.</p>
                     <p>The Front half-Files extent or bounds, reacheth no farther then from the Front, unto the midſt of Ranks, or to the Bringers-up of the Front half-files, which being but ſix deep, is the third Rank from the Front; and the length of the ſame reacheth from the outmoſt part of the left Flank, until you come unto the right.</p>
                     <p>The Reer half-Files beginneth from the midſt of Ranks, or from the fourth Rank from the Front, and runneth downward in his depth to the Bringer-up of the whole File; and the Length of the ſame is to be taken ſide-wiſe, as they ſtand ſhoulder to ſhoulder, from the outmoſt man upon the left, unto the outmoſt man upon the right.</p>
                     <p>The right half-Ranks in their Length runneth no farther, then from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt man upon the right, unto the midſt of Files, or to the left-hand File-leader of the right half-Ranks; the Depth of the right half-Ranks reacheth from the Front, running down unto the Reer.</p>
                     <p>As for the left half-Ranks, as much may be ſaid, to take his Length from the midſt of Files, or from the right-hand File-leader, of the left half-Ranks unto the outmoſt Files upon the left; the Depth of the left half-Ranks, may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in form and manner conformable to the right.</p>
                     <p>Next come we to ſpeak of the Length and Depth of the whole Battail: the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108706:13"/>
Length of the Battail is ever to be accounted of the number of men in a Rank, and not in a File; for the Files perhaps may not be above ſix deep, when that there may be hundreds in a Breſt in the Ranks: and farther, the Length of any Battail is to be taken from the outmoſt point of the left Flank, or left-hand File-leader, ſtretching it ſelf forth by an even Line along, until you come to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt point of right Flank, or right-hand File-leader; the Depth of the Battail always is to be taken from the Front or firſt Rank, and going down backward in a ſtraight Line down to the Reer, to the laſt Rank, or to the Bringers-up of the Files. For as the Length of the Battail is to be taken from the left Flank, going along in Front unto the right; ſo the Depth of the Battail is to be taken from the Front, going backward down to the Reer.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo to be underſtood, that in every <hi>Battalia</hi> drawn up, there are other parts and Denominations, very conſiderable to be known, that is, in every ſuch an one, there is a Van-Guard, a Reer-Ward, and Main-Battail. The Van-Guard are the Muskettiers upon the right, or the right Flank; or as moſt commonly called amongſt us in theſe days, the Right-wing, or the Left-wing, which are the Muskettiers, and the Flankers of the Body of Pikes; the reaſon, as I conceive, the Muskettiers are accounted and called Wings, is becauſe they are firſt drawn off, as by flying motions in Forlorns, to engage againſt an Enemy; but of this by the way. To proceed: the Reer-Ward or Reer-Guard, are the Muskettiers on the left Flank; and the Battail is the Body of Pikes; and here I ſhall conclude concerning the deſcription of a Body.</p>

                     <p>HE that intends to exerciſe a Body of men, muſt truly know what he ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſo to give his directions unto the Souldiers, as they may aptly make ready execution of the ſame. He muſt at ſuch times above all the reſt, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume unto himſelf the confidence and preſence (as near as he is able) of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Souldier. He is alſo to ſtretch out his voice ſo, as he may conveniently be heard, and underſtood by the inferior Officers and Souldiers; which will cauſe them more readily to obey his commands. He ought to carry a chearful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unto them, provided they do well; but otherwiſe, if careleſly diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Commands, he may look harſhly upon them. His eyes ought to be quick and nimble, obſerving all their motions, whether it be to the right or left, to the Front or Reer, and nimbly ſtepping to them, to ſtay them, if diſorderly they ſwerve awry from what he firſt intended. He muſt likewiſe order all his words of Command ſo, as that they may be proper, and clearly pronounced forth unto the Souldier, without any faltering. And in every one of theſe, to ſee the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier leaſurely and eaſily perform the ſame in a compleat manner. He muſt not be too quick in his words of Command, but carefully ſee what before commanded well done, and then he may proceed unto the next. In time of his Exerciſe, he muſt ſeriouſly mind what he is to do, and not to have his thoughts extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried away upon any other Subject, for fear he be out; but if any ſuch thing ſhould happen through forgetfulneſs, he ought not to be daunted, but to pull up the ſpirit of a Souldier as well as he can, and endeavour to reduce them again. For it is a rare thing to be found, for a Leader to be ſo exquiſite in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing, as not to be ſometimes out; and in my obſervation of moſt, at one time or another, I have found them ſo to be. His diſcretion alſo ought to be ſuch, as to cull out, and chuſe thoſe things that be chiefeſt, as flowers out of a Garden, to fit and compleat up his Exerciſe in a Souldier-like way; which may be moſt propereſt for ſervice and uſe, which will bring to him far more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and praiſe in the judgement of every knowing Souldier, then to ſpend his time upon unneceſſary toyes; but yet ſometimes, to pleaſe the fancy of the curious, at their private meetings he may uſe ſome things for delight, to ſupport and uphold their private Exerciſes, which have nurſt up here in <hi>London</hi> many able Souldiers and Commanders, who have been ſerviceable to our Nation. It
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108706:13"/>
is a very neceſſary thing likewiſe that a Leader ſometimes do acquaint the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the uſe of their ſeveral Diſtances, Facings, Doublings, Counter-marches, and Wheelings, and of all things elſe he ſhall command; but in ſuch a manner, that he dwell not too long upon any thing he ſhall declare unto them, for dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Souldiers, who rather would be pleaſed with more actings, then by too much talkings; which ſpins out the time, as ſometimes ordered, to very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe. He muſt be very careful of every word of Command he gives, that the Souldiers be ordered in their due Diſtance, ſutable to the ſame, of what kind ſoever it be; and if it ſhall be loſt in their movings or marchings, he muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring them to it again. He is likewiſe to acquaint the Souldiers when they are drawn up, to look about them, and to mind their ſeveral places, how they ſtand in the Body, whether they be in even Ranks from the Front, or odd; if even, and upon any doubling of Ranks, they are the men to double the odd; if half-file-leaders, that they be commanded to double the Front; they muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their Arms, and are Leaders of that Motion to come up to double the Front; if Bringers-up commanded to double, they are alike to do the ſame; if Bringers up of the Front-half-files, and that they be commanded to double the Reer, they likewiſe are to advance their Arms, to face about, and are to begin to lead them down to the Reer. They ſhould likewiſe take notice how they ſtand in their Files, whether even from the right, or no; if even, and there be any command to double Files to the right, they all are to move, and double the odd; if commanded to double to the left, they then ſtand odd; and the others are to move, and double them. They likewiſe are to mind their places, who are upon the Flanks, for a doubling either to Front or Reer by the half-Files; they firſt begin to march, and how they ſtand there as right and left-hand men in even Ranks; for by any doublings of Ranks entire, or by Diviſion, they likewiſe are the Leaders of the Motion. There ought alſo advice be given to the middle File-leaders, to know their places; for if there ſhould be any doublings of the half-Ranks, they then are firſt to move, and to begin the motion.</p>
                     <p>This caution being ſometimes quickly run over in adviſing of the Souldiers, that they ſhould ever mind when they are firſt drawn up into a body theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places, they would not ſtand ſo careleſſy and ſo ignorantly in a Body, as many times they do, not knowing which way to move without a great deal of pains and directions from their Leader; for there being ſo many occaſions of doublings of theſe kinds, that it is a neceſſary thing for every Souldier to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Yet it is not only ſufficient that the Souldiers do mind their places as they ſtand in a body, according to the direction of their <hi>Leader,</hi> as before ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but that they be likewiſe, in the time of their Exerciſe, very ſilent in the body, and helpful unto their fellow-Souldiers, by pointing out unto them with ſigns with the hand, where they ſhould march, to perform what was before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and to be very civil and orderly in their carriage to each other, and to mind their Exerciſe ſo as a matter of great weight, and high conſideration in the well regarding of the ſame. And if a word of command (as ſometimes may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen) ſlip out of order, as by the miſtaking of a hand or the like, yet nevertheleſs it ſhould be their modeſt care, if not prevented by their Leader, to be ready to execute what they conceive he intended; and walking along in this civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective way unto him that ſhall lead them, it will not only be a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement unto him, but they will alſo reap much benefit unto themſelves.</p>
                     <p>And thus much briefly may be ſpoken in way of advice unto every Leader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his beginning of his Exerciſe, and unto each particular Souldier as ſhall by him be exerciſed.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of <hi>Facings,</hi> of their ſeveral kinds, and of their uſe, with the words of command for performance of the ſame.</head>
                     <p>FAcing is the altering or turning of the Aſpect to either hand upon the ground they ſtand, according to the words of Command, whether it be to the right,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108706:14"/>
left, Front or Reer, or to the midſt of Files or Ranks, or to any of the outward or inward Angles, or to the Center.</p>
                     <p>The manner of execution of the ſame, it is a particular turning of every Souldiers countenance unto each of thoſe hands or places as above expreſt, and to be performed after this manner. The left foot is always to be kept fixed like the hinge of a door, and unto what hand or part they ſhall be commanded to face, every particular Souldier is immediately to turn his body upon the Ball or Centre of his left foot by wheeling, until he hath brought his Aſpect unto the place commanded.</p>
                     <p>Facings is one of the moſt neceſſary and uſefulleſt motions amongſt all the reſt: for when the body ſhall be in ſuch a ſtreight that they cannot bring their faces againſt an enemy by Counter-march, or by a Wheeling, to bring their beſt Souldiers there to fight; and likewiſe being debarred of room that they cannot double it, nevertheleſs Facings are of ſuch excellent uſe, that they may with eaſe, although ſtanding at cloſe Order, turn every particular face to charge upon that part where they ſhall be aſſaulted by an enemy: and farther, this motion is performed with more facility then all the reſt of the motions. For in the others they alter the form of the Battail, or changeth the place, but in this they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve both, and it is ready for any attempt of an enemy: if they ſhould be charged all at once in Front, Reer, right and left Flanks, they may be commanded ſo to face, as to anſwer them all in every one of their charges.</p>
                     <p>Facings likewiſe are ſo neceſſary, that they can hardly be ſpared in any other of the motions, having relation in one kind or other to them all for to be uſed. There is likewiſe farther to be underſtood, that there are Entire-Facings and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſional. Entire Facings are when they turn their Aſpects all one way: Diviſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Facings are when they divert or turn their faces ſeveral ways, as to the Front, Reer, and both Flanks, all at one inſtant of time as ſhall be commanded.</p>
                     <p>There are likewiſe facings to the Front and Reer Angles, that is to ſay, of their outward and inward Angles. Outward Angles are when they are commanded to face to the right Angle or to the left, or both facing to the inward Angles, as when they are commanded ſo, as to face to the inward Angles towards the midſt of Files. There is likewiſe facing to the inward Angles towards the midſt of Ranks as to the Center; where note, when there is any uſe of theſe Facings unto the inward Angles, it is occaſioned by ſome former words of command, that hath made ſome large intervals in the midſt of Ranks or Files, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may give them ſuch commands as theſe for to open or ſtand ſo, that they may march and cloſe again as at firſt.</p>
                     <p>This Facing to the Center, I do conceive to be very uſeful, when the Captain or Leader hath any thing of importance to ſpeak unto the Company; they ſtanding at cloſe order, he may ſide-wiſe move down into the midſt of the Ranks and Files, and command them to face all to the Center; they ſtanding all round about him ſo cloſe, cannot chuſe but hear and know what his pleaſure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand will be, and in obedience thereunto, be very ready in performance for the execution of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But before I come to ſet down the words of Command for Facings, I ſhall deſire all Leaders not to tye themſelves up ſo as not to begin in their Exerciſe to command Facings, until they have brought the Souldiers to ſtand at open order, both in Rank and File, as if it were not proper for them to command them to face till then. Therefore rather, for the reaſons before ſet forth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to chuſe upon ſuch cloſe Diſtances to face, that they may know the true uſe of them, and at ſuch times when they want ground that the other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot be performed.</p>

As you were, or, To your Leader.</p>
                     <p>Having concluded the words of Command for performing of plain Facings, there muſt be notice taken, when any word of Command ſhall be given to face to any of the Reer-Angles, they muſt be firſt faced to the Reer, and they will make more eaſier performance of the ſame; and likewiſe, if any word of Command be given to face to the inward Angles upon the Flanks, they muſt face them there likewiſe firſt, and it will be eaſier fulfilled: and likewiſe if any command be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to face to the four Angles, or to Front, Reer, and Midſt from the Center, care muſt be firſt had that they may be firſt faced to the Center.</p>
                     <p>I might have proceeded a great deal farther in this place upon this Subject of <hi>Facings,</hi> to have ſhewn ſeveral figures of Battail that might be produced and drawn forth, affording much variety of forms and number, and with much eaſe to be performed upon their ſeveral marchings, according as they are ordered to face, which might be very uſeful for ſervice, and affording much matter for any particular Exerciſe, to uſe ſeveral firings upon the ſame. But I ſhall have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in another place to make uſe of divers of them, and ſetting them forth in the view, when I ſhall begin to ſet down in any particular Leadings of my own, which I have performed in our private meetings at <hi>Town-Ditch</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> every Thurſday-morning, for the ſatisfaction of thoſe loving Gentlemen who ſtill do Exerciſe there, and to ſuch which ſhall come after.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIX,</hi> The many variety of <hi>Doublings,</hi> with their parts and uſes ſet forth for the practice of any Commander, to make uſe of according unto his own diſcretion.</head>
                     <p>SInce there is in the true account, no other dimenſion of a Battail, but the Length and Depth, ſo likewiſe it is to be underſtood, that the Length of the Battail is doubled by the doublings of Ranks and half-Files; and the Depth of the Battail is doubled by the doubling of Files, and of the half-Ranks. Now there are ſeveral Words of Command for the performance of each of theſe, as to double Ranks and Files, which do conſiſt either of the doubling of number of men and perſons, and not of place, or elſe the doubling both of number and place. As for Example, command either the Ranks, the half-files, or Bringers-up to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108706:15"/>
double the Front to the right; here only is the doubling of number of men, and not of place, for it adds but one man more to that hand, whereunto they were commanded, and gains but his particular place. Again, double Ranks to any hand entire or double, the Front by the half-Files to the right entire, it will be not only a doubling of the number of men, but a doubling of the place, and the Length of the Battail. The uſe of doubling the Length of the Battail may be for two Reaſons, the one to over-wing an Enemy, the other to avoid over-winging our ſelves. Yet there muſt be care taken, that in doubling of the Length, that we fail not, or be too weak in our Depth: for the want of both, either Length or Depth, may be very dangerous to our ſelves, and may give great advantage to the Enemy. For if there ſhould want a ſufficient Depth, by gaining much Length in the Front, we may perhaps be ſo weak there, that an Enemy may quickly break through, whereby much danger may enſue upon the ſame, if not timely prevented by the diſcretion of the Commanders.</p>
                     <p>There is likewiſe in the doubling of Files, or the half-Ranks doubling to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flank, a doubling of number of men, and not of place, carrying much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of words of Command; but the doubling of Files, and of the left half-Ranks entire, the Depth of the right Flank is not only a doubling of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but a doubling of the place and Depth of the Battail. In this doubling of the Depth care likewiſe muſt be had, that we make not the Front too narrow, leſt we give opportunity to the Enemy to encircle, and encompaſs it. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, take notice that Doublings were invented to ſtrengthen any part of the Body that ſhall be weak, whether in the Front, or Reer-right-flank, or left, whether it be in number of men or place, Length or Depth, it is to be uſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſcretion of the Commander. There is likewiſe farther to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in Doublings, whether they double the number or place, Length or Depth, it is to be performed by one of theſe two, either entire, or diviſional Doublings: therefore I ſhall proceed, and go on to ſhew what I conceive to be the propereſt way in the progreſs of them in a right order; and therefore I will begin to ſet down the words of Command; Firſt, to double the Front, and ſo far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceed to ſhew the Doublings of the Flanks. And firſt of entire Doublings, and next of the diviſional; and in the mean time, I ſhall crave pardon from the courteous Souldier, that I put not down ſeveral Pricks or Figures to ſet forth the ſame, endeavouring rather to give him the words of Command for each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doubling, with directions for performance of the ſame, together with their ſeveral Reducements, leaving it to his ingenious ſtudy and practice, to make uſe of what he pleaſeth, where he may cull and chuſe out ſuch as ſhall be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and fit, either for ſervice or delight; by the way adviſing him to retain in his memory, what he intends to practiſe, and not to meddle with any thing, but what he aſſuredly knows will carry ſuch weight and able reaſons for their uſe and ſervice, as ſhall admit of no controlment from the judicious Souldier.</p>

                     <p>Here endeth all the plain Doublings to the right Flank, performed by ſeveral Counter-marches and Wheelings, which to any ingenious Souldier are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent directions to know how to double the left Flank, only altering the hand by the words of Command.</p>
                     <p>And here fellow-Souldier endeth all the ſeveral kinds of Doublings, which if any ſhall ſeem hard or difficult unto thee, either in their Commands, Directions, or Reducements, thou mayſt (care being taken) with much eaſe and delight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſame. And here the Captain is to take ſpecial notice, when he comes to the point of Doublings, that his propereſt way will be firſt to double the Front, as being the moſt honourable part of the Body, and next the Reer, and after either to the right or left Flank, leaving it to his diſcretion to uſe as many of them as he ſhall think fitting, and convenient for his Exerciſe. And although I have ſomewhat varied from the practiſe of former times in uſing more plenty of words of Command, the ripeneſs and curioſity of Wits in theſe our days, enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me unto it; for they having much refined the <hi>Military Diſcipline,</hi> will not be pleaſed with ordinary ſtuff (as to ſay, <hi>As you were</hi>) which, I confeſs, would ſave the Captain a great deal of pains, and be more eaſie to the apprehenſion and capacity of every private Souldier, for his returning back unto his place again. Yet if Command ſhould be given to double any part of the Body, that Leader would quickly lie under a hard cenſure, and be judged in moſt mens opinions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, that could not find out ſome other words of Command to reduce them again. Endeavouring therefore to give full ſatisfaction to both parties, I have taken the pains to ſet down other words of Command for <hi>Reducement,</hi> whereby thoſe which ſhall profeſs themſelves curious, may cull out ſuch plenty as may beſt pleaſe their <hi>genius;</hi> adviſing them withal not to preſume in the exerciſing of their private Companies, before themſelves be firſt well verſt, and truly knowing in all and every of the ſeveral Commands, Directions, and Reducements before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; which being obtained, they may confidently and boldly proceed, ſo to inure their Souldiers in the practiſe thereof, that their own knowledge in a ſhort time will reduce them to their former places without uſing theſe thred-bare words, <hi>As you were;</hi> variety being more profitable and delightful unto them, (provided they underſtand it) then to accuſtom them in an ordinary and plain way of reducing.</p>

But, ſuppoſe many of theſe <hi>Doublings</hi> have not been ſeen by ſome to be uſed in the field; Are they not therefore uſeful? perhaps not at ſuch time they have had no occaſion for to uſe them all; which if not, muſt they be rejected? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer poſitively, that being rightly enquired into, they have in them very uſeful and ſerviceable things againſt an Enemy, whether it be in the Field, or in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. As for Example; the Muskettiers being brought either all into the Front or Reer, or upon one of the Flanks, which often hapneth, an Enemy appearing there, then they would be of ſigular good uſe for our advantage, and very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to the Enemy. The like may be ſpoken of the Pikes, who are by ſeveral of theſe <hi>Doublings</hi> brought into thoſe places, being there very ſerviceable to receive a deſperate Charge of Horſe, if upon any of theſe parts they ſhould fall on. Obſerve, further, that in many of theſe Doublings, as the one arms ſhall face or charge againſt an Enemy, ſo contrariwiſe the other lies more ſecure in ſafety to be preſerved from danger of the ſhot. Moreover, (according unto the number of men either in Length or Depth) a Leader may by theſe words of Command or the like, at the ſame time double his Front, Reer, or Midſt, by dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of Ranks; and may farther make uſe of them at one and the ſame time to double by Files his right, left Flank and Midſt, all at one inſtant. But I ſhall not need to ſet down words of Command for the doubling Front, Reer, Flanks and Midſt, after this manner, but leave that unto the apt Souldier to make uſe of ſuch words of Command formerly ſhewen, and to frame them ſuitable for any ſuch purpoſe ſo intended. But before I ſhall conclude concerning the uſe of theſe Doublings, as I ſaid before, there are many of them, which by command will bring any men in the Body to fight, unto that part which ſhall be moſt weak, or aſſaulted by an enemy. And again, he may caſt them ſo into the Body by a doubling, as ſhall preſerve from danger whom he ſhall think fit. And to ſay more, there is no part of the Body or Arms but by words of Command in doublings may be brought forth as <hi>Frontiers</hi> againſt the enemy, and may be placed again into the midſt of the Body for more ſecurity, and others in like manner may be brought forth for their relief. Therefore it much concerns all Souldiers and Commanders to be truly knowing in all the ſeveral kinds of Doublings, out of which he may make ſingular good uſe according to his diſcretion, at all ſuch times as need ſhall require, whether it be in Field, or otherwiſe in Garriſon.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXVIII.</hi> Of Inverſion and Converſion.</head>
                     <p>NOt to omit any thing which may be beneficial for the knowledge of all them that intend to be good proficients in the <hi>Art of Military Diſcipline,</hi> my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in this Chapter ſhall be of Ranks filing, and Files filing, and Ranks ranking, and Files ranking, which are by ſome called <hi>Inverſion</hi> and <hi>Converſion;</hi> yet ſeldom mentioned by any Leader in the time of his Exerciſe, for this reaſon, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe the Souldiers for the moſt part are unacquainted with them; which cauſeth all our Leaders in our private Meetings here in <hi>London,</hi> to deliver forth unto their Souldiers ſuch words of Command as may readily and aptly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by them, which are, Ranks, File to the right or left; or, Files, File to any hand; which is no other then <hi>Inverſion.</hi> And again, Ranks, rank to the right or left, either in equal or unequal parts, or entire to the Front; or Files to rank in the like kind, may be termed <hi>Converſion:</hi> And, in my opinion, they do the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſhall thus expreſs themſelves to the capacity of every Souldier, then for to puzzle them with the words <hi>Inverſion</hi> &amp; <hi>Converſion.</hi> I intend therefore without
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108706:19"/>
curioſity plainly to ſet down their ſeveral Commands, Directions, and Reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, keeping my former method concerning Doublings. For in all and every one of them, they do either double the length or depth of the Front, Reer, Midſt, or Flanks; no part of the <hi>Military Exerciſe</hi> affording more plenty of matter then they, carrying always along with them many things of excellent uſe. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuppoſe a Prince, General, or any other perſon of quality were to paſs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Company, a diſcreet commander would preſently command their Ranks to <hi>invert,</hi> or file to the right and left outward, which immediately becomes (as it were) a Street or Gallery, for the honouring and ſecuring of their perſons. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is of uſe for the lodging of the Colours, or upon Funeral-occaſions, or taking their leave from their Captain, where they may pour forth their Volleys of ſhot all at one and the ſame time. To be ſhort, being neceſſitated to march againſt a Battery, it avoids the danger of the great Ordnance, and likewiſe ſecures the Front of the Battalia from the imminent danger of any great ſhower of ſmall ſhot poured forth by the Enemy. As likewiſe it is of excellent uſe to march over a narrow Bridge, or thorow a Lane, Thicket, or Salliport, or ſuch like difficult paſſages; or if any Commander have a deſire to uſe ancient Figures, by it he may make the <hi>Saw, Sheers,</hi> or <hi>Diamond;</hi> or being in one File, they may aptly be drawn into a <hi>Ring,</hi> where he that is an able poſture-man ſtanding in the midſt, may ſhew unto them their ſeveral poſtures, and after eaſily reduce them again: and thus much briefly of <hi>Inverſion,</hi> or <hi>Ranks filing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next come we to ſhew the excellent uſes and ſervices which may be performed by <hi>Converſion,</hi> as firſt perceiving any man of worth to ſtand before the Front of the Battail, or to paſs by either of the Flanks, then Ranks ranking, or Files ranking into the Front, or Ranks wheeling to either of the Flanks, by theſe Commands the Souldiers aſpects are thither brought to preſent unto him a volley of ſhot. It is likewiſe very uſeful for the making of a Line againſt a Breaſt-work, or lining of Hedges, carrying it ſelf ſeveral ways ſecretly to lie in <hi>Ambuſcado,</hi> whereby they may fire upon the Enemy as he marcheth by. Or approaching againſt any Fort or place of danger, they may daringly make a large Front and firing upon them; after filing to the right or left, making large Intervals, they much preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the danger of the great ſhot proceeding from the Enemy. Again, Ranks ranking either in equal or unequal parts, is of ſingular good uſe upon a narrow paſſage, where they can march but two, three, four, or ſix abreſt; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, notwithſtanding they marched before twenty abreſt, may by it bring them to ſuch ſmall numbers, whereby he may much preſerve them in time of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger and peril. To dwell no longer upon this diſcourſe, <hi>Inverſion</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> many times require larger diſtance then any other of the Motions, as ſometimes double diſtance: or twice double diſtance, wherefore being ſo many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for the uſe of them both, I hold it requiſite for a Leader frequently to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe his Souldiers in them; no part of the <hi>Art Military</hi> affording more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations to the Souldiers that ſhall readily and handſomly perform the ſame. Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore paſſing over what might be more ſpoken concerning them, I ſhall in the next place ſet them all forth in their full view, leaving every diſcreet Souldier to his own liberty, to make uſe of as many of them as he ſhall think fit, and to uſe them after what manner he pleaſeth.</p>

I come therefore in the next place only to mention the ranking into the midſt by Ranks and Files, which may likewiſe be performed by the former words of Command, provided they have convenient diſtance, and be faced to the midſt, and after the Command is executed, to face them to their firſt Front. Yet there is remaining a ranking unto all theſe places at once; for the performance of which, obſerve theſe few words of Command following.</p>

                     <p>Having dwelt thus long upon this ſubject of Inverſion and Converſion (occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned thereunto by their great variety and difficulty in the performance of them,) I hold it convenient to give a breathing ſpace unto the wearied Souldier, whilſt I in the mean time prepare further matter for his longing deſire.</p>
                     <p>Yet before I enter in any other diſcourſe of the <hi>Art Military,</hi> I hold it requiſite to give ſome admonitions to thoſe that ſhall venture upon them. For being very difficult, they are not eaſily underſtood by every puny; my advice therefore is, to wave ſuch things in time of Exerciſe, which the Souldiers are unacquainted with, providing for them ſuch matter as is both plain and eaſie; and being frequently practiſed in ſuch, he may after drill them on to harder, till by degrees he hath brought them unto ſuch perfection and knowledge, that they ſhall be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and execute what is commanded; not gazing upon one another, (as I have often obſerved) neither knowing their Leaders meaning; or if they did, they are altogether ignorant how to fulfil his commands. Frequent practice therefore makes the Souldier expert, witneſs our gallant Souldiers and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who are moſt of them ſo well grounded (by frequent practice) that their Leaders can ſcarce give a word of Command, which is not eaſily apprehended by them, they being in their exerciſes ſo often inured to ſuch difficult expreſſions as theſe of Inverſion and Converſion.</p>

                        </gap>ir ſeveral ſorts and kinds, affording much variety in time of Exerciſe.</head>
                     <p>THoſe which have a longing deſire to be throughly knowing in this part or branch of <hi>Military Diſcipline,</hi> muſt take notice of theſe four ſorts, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Counter-marching of Files, next of Ranks, after the Front and Reer-half-files, and laſtly, of right and left Half-ranks: all which are performed either by intire or Diviſional Counter-marches, or elſe by the intire changing of ground; and that by many ways, the Front-half-files with the Reer, the right Half-ranks with the left: So that an expert Leader may venter ſo far in them, as to continue his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe (without reducing) almoſt for an hour, and not to expreſs himſelf twice in any one word of Command; they affording ſuch plenty and variety in them, that with pleaſure, uſing but four words of Command, he may bring each Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier into his proper place again; obſerving theſe directions following. As firſt, to look down in the Body, where his File-leaders are, and where his Bringers-up: &amp; likewiſe marking the ſeveral places of his Half-file-leaders, &amp; the Bringers up of his Front-half-files, together with his Flankers &amp; his middle Files: this ſpecial care being taken, he may begin and proceed to the Reducement, after this manner.</p>
                     <p>If by ſome former Counter-marches his File-leaders are in the place of his Half-file-leaders, and that his Bringers-up are in the room of the Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers-up of the Front-half-files, then he may proceed in this, or the like kinde,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108706:25"/>
commanding them to countermarch their Front and Reer into the midſt; which being performed, they will ſtand in ſome pretty way of reducing; after facing them to the Front, where he meets with his Bringers-up, in ſtead of his File-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which by one Counter-march will bring them up again into the Front. Yet perhaps the Flankers have inter-changed ground with the middle File-leaders: if ſo, then Counter-march their Flanks into the midſt, and face them to the Front: and if it happen that the right Flank is become the left, and the left the right; then Counter-march their Ranks to any hand, and after face them to the firſt Front they are reduced. And farther, take this for a general rule, that when Files or Ranks Counter-march to any hand, command them to Counter-march to the contrary, and it will reduce them; or countermarching your Front and Reer into the midſt, counter-marching of them back again from the midſt will bring each man into his proper place again. The ſame rule being obſerved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the Flankers, or Front and Reer-half-files, counter-marching of them from the midſt.</p>
                     <p>Counter-marches rightly conſidered, branch themſelves forth into theſe three particulars.</p>
                     <p>The
<list>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Macedonian.</hi>

                           </item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Chorean.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Macedonian</hi> is a Counter-march of gaining ground, for that it leaveth the ground it formerly ſtood upon, and in lieu thereof taketh the ground before the Front, and turneth their Aſpects unto the Reer.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> is a Counter-march of loſing ground, for that it leaveth the ground it firſt ſtood upon, and in room thereof, taketh the ground which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Reer; thither likewiſe altering the Souldiers Aſpects.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chorean</hi> is a Counter-march maintaining ground, keeping the ground the Battalia formerly ſtood upon, every Souldier taking anothers place; it likewiſe turns the Aſpect towards the Reer.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee (for all their great variety which latter ages have invented) they conſiſt but of three ſorts or kinds, either maintaining, gaining, or loſing of ground; and may be performed (as I ſaid before) either by intire or diviſional Counter-marches.</p>
                     <p>It may now be expected that I declare unto the Souldier the meaning of each particular Counter-march; briefly therefore, thus: Files counter-marching is, when every Souldier followeth his Leader; Ranks counter-marching is, when every Souldier followeth his ſide-man, whether it be to the right-hand or to the left: Front and Reer-half-files counter-marching is, ſometimes when every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Souldier followeth his Leader or Bringer-up; or elſe when they follow their Half-file-leaders, or their Bringers-up of the Front-half-files, or the like: Right and left Half-ranks counter-marching is, when every Souldier in the Rank followeth the outmoſt men upon the right and left; or when they ſhall follow their inſide right and left-hand-men, or the like. What hath hitherto been ſpoken may be ſufficient, both for the inſtruction and direction of any diſcreet Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier: I come in the next place to ſet them all before them as they lie in Order.</p>

                     <p>Thus much may ſuffice to be ſpoken of all the ſeveral ſorts and kinds of Counter-marches; which if any ſhall conceive my pains fruitleſs in culling out ſuch plenty and variety, there being ſo few of them practiſed among able and knowing Souldiers; my beſt apology will be, The high and venerable eſteem I had of Antiquity neceſſitated me thereunto; as alſo to give full ſatisfaction to the Leaders of our private Meetings, who of late have laboured to inure their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the full practice thereof, made me the willinger rather to undergo the cenſure of ſome, then to incur the diſpleaſure of many. Yet by the way, give me leave fully to declare my ſelf concerning the uſe of them: for my opinion is, that of all the Motions tending to Martial Diſcipline, theſe may the beſt be ſpared, as being of little uſe, and not ſo much as practiſed abroad upon ſervice; and therefore the fewer of them any Leader ſhall uſe in his Exerciſe, in my judgement he doth the better, not ſpending time in needleſs ſpeeches, telling of his Souldiers that this is the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> this is the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> or <hi>Chorean Counter-march.</hi> Not to lie under the cenſure my ſelf of miſpending time, I come therefore briefly in the next place to treat of Wheelings, being a ſubject more profitable for the intelligible Souldier.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. LV.</hi> Of Wheelings, with their ſeveral uſes.</head>
                     <p>HAving proceeded thus far in ſhewing all the ſeveral ſorts and kinds of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Motions, it will now in the next place be expected that I ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Wheelings, and as formerly, ſo now, to ſet before the Souldier their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds and uſes. Wherefore take notice of two ſorts, Wheelings Angular, and VVheelings on the Center, (which latter is commonly called the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his VVheeling) being acted or performed by the Souldier two ſeveral ways; that is to ſay, Intire or Diviſional.</p>
                     <p>Intire VVheelings to the Angles, are when the Souldiers turn their Aſpects from the Front proper to either of the Flanks or Reer, whereby they may gain the VVind or Sun, or ſome like advantage, bringing their beſt Souldiers thither for to encounter an Enemy. For the better performance of this Motion, it will be convenient to cloſe Ranks and Files into the midſt to order, and to keep their due diſtance both in Rank and File, obſerving in their Ranks their right and left-hand-men, &amp; following their Leaders, always conforming themſelves in their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the moſt commendable Poſture, which is Pikes advanced, &amp; Muskets poyſed. Wheeling the Battail on the Center, is when they are ſo ſtraightened with ground, that they have not room to wheel to the right or left, as in the former, which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108706:28"/>
gaineth as much more ground before the Front, as formerly they ſtood on. This Wheeling brings their beſt Souldiers to either of the Flanks or Reer. I could wiſh that this Wheeling were more often practiſed amongſt us, for by it the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are better kept together in their Motion, being not ſo apt to flie out, as in the former.</p>
                     <p>Diviſional Wheelings (provided they have ſufficient number of men) are of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular good uſe to encounter ſeveral Enemies at one and the ſame time, which the Front of our Battalia bringing our beſt Souldiers for to skirmiſh with them. It is likewiſe uſeful to bring either Arms into Front, Reer, or both the Flanks: for ſuppoſe the Muskettiers to be upon the Flanks, and fearing a deſperate charge of the Horſe to fall upon them by a Diviſion of Wheeling, the Pikes are thither brought to receive their on-ſet; and in the mean ſpace, the Muskettiers have time to recruit their Bandiliers again. Much more might be ſpoken, but my intent is not to fill my Book with impertinent diſcourſes, knowing what is already ſpoken is ſufficient for the intelligible Souldier.</p>

                     <p>Theſe are all the intire and diviſional Wheelings that have hitherto been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by any, according to my beſt obſervation: there are other Wheelings which may properly be term'd Doublings, which I have placed amongſt the Doublings, where they more properly belong. Now if any ſhall demand of me a reaſon why I have omitted the Reducements to each particular Command; my anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is eaſie: for as in the Counter-marches, ſo in theſe, they may be reduced by three or four words of Command, except a Commander ſhall of ſet purpoſe keep them off from the ſame, to make ſome experiment. After any wheeling is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, face them after to the firſt Front, and command them to even their Ranks, and ſtraighten their Files, they will be as at firſt; and unto what hand ſoever they wheeled, command them to wheel to the contrary hand, and they will be reduced unto the firſt Front; or what part is wheeled off by Diviſion, wheel them inward again from that place, and it will eaſily reduce them. Thus you ſee that it is almoſt impoſſible for a Leader to be out, unleſs he be extreamly ignorant; therefore he need not fear to venter far in the progreſs of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall reduce them, provided he uſe no Doublings: which if he ſhall, great care muſt be had that he be not put to a ſtand; for the prevention whereof, let him look back unto thoſe doublings by wheelings, wherein one doth reduce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where he may finde ſome remedy to help himſelf forth again.</p>

                     <p>THe chiefeſt thing required of the Muskettiers next their Poſtures, by which they are taught how to handle their Arms with delight both marching or skirmiſhing, is Firing; which to ſpeak the truth, is the full accompliſhment of all the reſt; for unleſs they be really performed, the reſt are of no great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. For to what end is it for any man to Prime, Lade or Cock, if he Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent not anſwerably? therefore Firings are the execution of all the former; in ſo much as my advice ſhall be to all Commanders, that they be careful and diligent to have all their Muskettiers often practiſed with falſe Firing; whch is, Firing in the Pan only, and falling off, as hereafter followeth, to the end that in

time of need they may not ſpend their Powder and Bullets in vain. And that they may likewiſe know where to fall off, that others may do the like, and where to place themſelves ſecureſt from danger; yet ſo as they may be ſtill aiding the one unto the other: I ſhall therefore for the good of my Country, and for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of all ſuch as are herein concerned, collect forth ſome <hi>Firings,</hi> which ſhall be every one differing from the other in one kind or other, either in the execution or reducing, whereby the ingenious Souldier may cull forth ſuch as he beſt likes to make uſe of, what he ſhall think to be moſt fit and pertinent to his intended purpoſe, be it either for delight or ſervice; briefly therefore thus. <hi>Firings</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidered, can be performed but five ways, that is to ſay, to the <hi>Front, Reer, right</hi> or <hi>left Flank, Oblique</hi> or <hi>Angular;</hi> but there is ſo much variety to be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the performance of each of theſe, that it makes them ſeem ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Firings,</hi> as by the following diſcourſe ſhall be fully demonſtrated.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Firings may as well be performed to both Flanks as to one, the Body being faced accordingly, which would make many Firings more; but theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſet down may be ſufficient for any ingenious capacity to work upon for the preſent; obſerving this rule, that in every Firing he ſhall make uſe of in time of his Exerciſe, he may reduce them by another; which will be more pleaſing to the Souldier, by reaſon of the great variety it affords unto them. Now now in the laſt place, I know it will be expected, that I ſhould ſpeak ſomething of the uſe of Firings: wherefore briefly thus:</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Front marching or moving, when we either purſue after, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to an Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Front, maintaining ground when two Bodies encounter one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Front, loſing ground, when either we are forced thereunto by neceſſity, or that we do it out of policy, to draw the Enemy into a train or ſnare.</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Reer marching, when we are purſued by an Enemy, yet would continue our March until we have gained ſome place of importance or advantage.</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Reer upon a Stand, when we are compelled thereunto by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent purſuit of an Enemy; or elſe when we have gained a place of advantage of ground, or have recovered the Wind or Sun, whereby we are the better able to encounter with them.</p>
                     <p>Firings to the Flank or Flanks marching, when we are aſſaulted by ſome Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcado ſecretly placed to hinder our paſſage; or ſuppoſing two Armies are marching to one and the ſame place, a River being betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>Firings to Flank or Flanks ſtanding, when the Enemy chargeth on with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to cut off or divide part of the Army from the other.</p>
                     <p>Having thus briefly ſet down ſeveral Firings to Front, Reer and both Flanks, with their uſes, either marching or ſtanding: I hold it convenient in the next place to give ſome ſhort directions in time Battail, both to the Officers and their Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that the Drummers have a vigilant eye upon their Commanders, whoſe voices are drown'd by the loud thundring of the Cannon or Muskettiers; as alſo by the neighing of Horſes, or the lamentable cries of the maim'd and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souldiers; at which time the Leaders Staff, Half-pike, or what elſe he carries in his hand, may be ſufficient for to inſtruct them to continue their charge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, or elſe to charge home.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the Serjeants be careful in time of Battail, that their Souldiers be at their due diſtance of order both in Rank and File; and that upon their Firings, whether they be Forlorns either of Files or Ranks drawn forth, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe by Diviſions, they ſee them neatly and handſomely perform'd by cocking
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108706:30"/>
their Matches, and preſenting ſomething lower then breſt-high, and after Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocking and returning them, wheeling off either to the right, left, or both, falling in the Reer of themſelves, or elſewhere as ſhall be appointed, in an orderly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereby they may decently come up again to Fire againſt the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that the Souldiers preſent and give fire upon their Reſts, not uſing that ſlovenly poſture of popping their Matches into the Pan, their Muskets being on their left ſides; which is not onely hurtful unto themſelves, but much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers their Fellow-ſouldiers; and by ſo doing, they ſcarce or ever do any execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt an Enemy. But here I meet with an objection framed by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers after this manner: Our Reſts are of little or no uſe unto us in time of skirmiſhing; fit they are, we confeſs, in the Military Gardens, but in time of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail both troubleſome and cumberſome unto us. To whom I reply, what if they be a little cumberſome at firſt, muſt they therefore be rejected and careleſly thrown away? nay, rather they ought frequently to practice themſelves in the uſe thereof; which if they did, they would finde the ſame very ſerviceable unto them in the time of skirmiſhing; wherewith they Fire better, and in a more comely and graceful way, far more ſecuring both themſelves and Fellow-ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from danger; and likewiſe upon their March it is both a help and ſupport unto them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, their eyes ought likewiſe in time of Battail to be fixed ſtedfaſtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Captain, always conforming to him in Poſture when he ſhall prepare to charge or retreat; and likewiſe they ought to be knowing and well verſt in the ſeveral Beats of the Drum; which if well obſerved by all, there would not be ſo much confuſion in time of Battail amongſt them, as many times by ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath been found, when diſregarding their Officers commands and the bearing of the Drum, they ignorantly and raſhly run on in a diſorderly manner; by which means they have cut off their own Officers and Fellow-ſouldiers, many times, more then they have dangered the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee what great neceſſity there is of inſtructing and training up the Souldiers in their Poſtures; and how requiſite it is to conform themſelves to their Officers in time of Battail, performing thereby better execution againſt their Enemies; and by their decent and comely array preſerve themſelves from eminent dangers and perils.</p>
                     <p>The Souldiers having now all the ground-work of the exerciſing a Body of men laid down before them, in the next place he labours to make experiment thereof; but being no Officer, he cannot attain thereunto without ſpecial leave from his Superiours; and therefore (being a File-leader) he craves leave for to exerciſe his ſingle File both in their Poſtures and Motions, contenting himſelf for preſent with that ſmall number, whereby he is able to run through many plain things of Diſtances, Facings, Doublings, Counter-marchings and Wheelings. But being not fully ſatisfied, he preſumes upon the former favour had from his Superiours, to go on to make every man in his File a File-leader; firſt by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and after (being not called away by the beat of the Drum, or by his Officers, to lead up his File and to joyn into a Body) according unto Dignity, and after endeavours to reduce them again by proper words of command.</p>
                     <p>This liberty being granted at convenient times unto a File-leader, much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers the Souldiers good affections unto their Officers; and is a means whereby many others are brought in to be true lovers of Military Exerciſe, as being much taken and well pleaſed with the ſight of the former things. And therefore, I could wiſh that they were not hereafter prevented, as formerly I have obſerved by the malice of ſome, who have had places of command beſtowed upon them, more through favour, or by reaſon of their riches, then for any worth or deſert found in them: They perhaps hold it a great diſpargement unto them to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed; but a judicious and diſcreet Captain accounts it a great honour to lead ſuch gallant men that are as able and as well knowing as himſelf.</p>

                     <p>Although I have here ſet down words of Command to make every man a File-leader, both by Succeſſion and Dignity, a Commander is not thereby tyed up, but may, if he pleaſe, practiſe the ſame upon a whole Company, altering but a little ſome words of Command. As for Example, we cannot ſay in a File, Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Ranks, there being none, until there be ſome other Files joyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: and therefore if we intend a doubling by a ſingle File, we command it to rank two to the right or left, which in a Company muſt be expreſt, Ranks to the right or left double. Thus you ſee with a little alteration every man is brought up into the Front, either by Succeſſion or Dignity; whether the Files be even numbers or odd, great bodies or ſmall. But here by the way, I muſt crave pardon to ſpeak ſomething in commendation of theſe Doublings, in anſwer to them that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them but Toys: to whom I will be ſo bold as to tell them, that it is not for want of ignorance they ſo ſlightly eſteem of them; for were they truly knowing in the Art of Drilling, they muſt of force confeſs abundance of variety in them, affording much delight to him that ſhall command, and great content unto them that are commanded, perceiving themſelves to be made File-leaders by the skill and worth of their Leaders. And beſides, there may be juſt cauſe (at one time or other) many times to alter the Ranks, exchanging the one for the other, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby their beſt deſerving Souldiers into the chiefeſt places of honour; and caſting others into their rooms at the diſcretion of the Commander. Therefore, I could wiſh all Leaders whatſoever to be well skill'd and verſt in theſe Doublings; the frequent practice whereof will make them more apt in the Exerciſe of more difficult things in the <hi>Art Military.</hi> To which ingenious ſtudy, I leave them; and in the next place proceed to ſhew them ſeveral Figures of Battail to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſingle Files, conſiſting of ſeveral Depths of men.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. LXIV.</hi> Concerning Figures of Battail to be performed by ſingles Files, with ſome admonitions to thoſe that ſhall practice themſelves therein.</head>
                     <p>THe great plenty and variety of matter that may be performed in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of a ſingle File, makes me wonder at the ignorance of thoſe who are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108706:32"/>
famed abroad for able knowing Souldiers; who after they have paſſed over the Poſtures are at a ſtand, as if there were nothing elſe to be done with the ſame. But did they truely underſtand what diſhonour and diſparagement it is unto them, they would not be ſo idle and backward, but ſet times a part, often inuring themſelves to the practice thereof, going through all the Motions, Diſtances, Facings, Doublings, Counter-marches and Wheelings; and may farther, if he pleaſe, with his ſingle File draw forth divers Figures of Battail, declaring unto his Souldiers their ſeveral reaſons and uſes. The exerciſing his Company after this manner, affords unto them both content and delight; and it is likewiſe very uſeful in greater Bodies, when time of need ſhall require, as ſhall appear in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this Book.</p>
                     <p>But here, me thinks, I hear ſome ſay, Of what uſe are your Figures? ſeeing for the moſt part in pitcht Battails, or skirmiſhes in the field, they commonly fire one againſt another in Square, or by Forlorns drawn forth from the Body, and being relieved, return into their places again. To whom, I anſwer, that in one reſpect it is true, there being ſcarce any pitcht Battail in the field fought in theſe latter times, but it hath been with even Fronts, who are firſt engaged; whether it be by Diviſions drawn off by way of Forlorns, Wings or Battail, they fight with even Fronts or Squadrons, as having every five or ſix Files divided a part from each other, having ſix foot ground interval betwixt the aboveſaid number of Files for the conveniency of the Ranks, wheeling off after they have fired. As concerning ſuch Figures as are framed like the Wedge, Saw, Sheers, or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; I muſt confeſs there is little or no uſe at all, except it be for delight, or for the practice and experience of ſome young Souldier, whereby he may plainly ſee the cuſtom of the Ancients in ſetting forth ſuch ancient Figures. But to let this paſs, and to come to the place where we left; I ſhall ſhew unto the Souldier how needful it is for him to be well skilled in the framing of Figures of Battail, and likewiſe to be throughly acquainted with their ſeveral uſes. Wherefore take this for a general rule, that there was never any pitcht Battail, but there were Reſerves appointed out unto all the parts thereof, whereby they might bring off, and at time of need relieve each other; and if ſo, certainly they muſt of neceſſity carry along with them ſeveral forms and Figures of Battail, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diſcretion of the Major-general, or the Commanders in chief whom it ſhall concern. It will therefore be expedient (ſince there is a neceſſity of Figures of Battail, and for the ſetting apart of Diviſions for the relieving of each other) for every Commander that will be truely knowing, to have always ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in his memory; that in time of need, he may not be to ſeek, or wanting in them. To which purpoſe I have collected ſome few, putting them to their view, being formerly practiſed by me, for the ſatisfaction of thoſe loving Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen which have private Meetings in <hi>London;</hi> but more eſpecially for thoſe of the <hi>Town-ditch,</hi> unto whom I am eſpecially bound. And therefore without more delay, I ſhall lay before them certain Figures of Battail upon all the Depths of Files ſet forth in the former Table, leaving them to their own diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make uſe of what ſhall beſt comply, and ſuit to their intended purpoſe.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He great delight in handling of Arms in <hi>Military Exerciſes,</hi> makes the City of <hi>London</hi> and the Suburbs thereof famous through the whole World, by reaſon, as I conceive, of thoſe two great <hi>Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> or <hi>Academies</hi> of <hi>Military Diſcipline,</hi> the <hi>Artillery</hi> and <hi>Military Garden,</hi> from whom, as out of pure Fountains, all other our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Meetings (as of <hi>Townditch,</hi> and <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> &amp;c.) are derived.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Artillery Gardens</hi> deſerves the firſt place, in reſpect it is the greateſt Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from whence, as it were out of a <hi>Nurſery,</hi> have been tranſplanted many able knowing Souldiers both at home and in foraign Countries, to the great honour of our Nation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Military Garden</hi> is famous likewiſe for the great improvement of divers worthy perſons of quality daily thither reſorting, whoſe excellent skill in <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Exerciſes hath raiſed many of them to high preferment here at home, and to places of honourable command abroad. The Captains in chief of theſe Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are Major General <hi>Skippon,</hi> and Major <hi>Henry Tyllier,</hi> which later was the firſt that ever ſhewed in the <hi>Military Garden</hi> (of which I am a member) the march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Souldiers in a Regimental way; whoſe great pains amongſt us deſerves much honour and high commendation; ſhewing unto us ſuch variety of matter in a Souldier-like way, as was never before ſeen by any member thereof.</p>
                     <p>Not to eclipſe the fore-mentioned <hi>Private Meetings</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> but to give them that due which belongs unto them, they likewiſe are of great honour and fame for their frequent exerciſing of their Souldiers in the handling of their <hi>Arms,</hi> whether it be of the <hi>Pike</hi> or <hi>Musket,</hi> and inſtructing them in the knowledge of <hi>Drilling,</hi> and drawing up of Companies, and Bodies of men, furniſhing both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms with able knowing Souldiers. My hearty wiſhes therefore are, that all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them may be propt up, and ſupported to all ages, that when need ſhall require, we may draw from theſe <hi>Fountains</hi> ſuch skilful and experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Officers as may be, as it were, a Bulwark to this our Nation.</p>
                     <p>Not to dwell any longer upon this diſcourſe, I come therefore briefly to ſet forth ſeveral Exerciſes (formerly practiſed by me amongſt thoſe loving Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Town-ditch</hi>) according to the uſual numbers there appearing, whether they be great or ſmall, practiſed for the moſt part with 24 or 32 men, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (although ſeldom) with 64 men, unleſs it were upon general days, when they were drawn forth into the field; at ſuch times, perhaps, there might be an appearance of greater numbers, as 120 and upwards.</p>
                     <p>My purpoſe therefore is to pitch upon, and to make uſe of all and every one
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108706:37"/>
of theſe numbers, making 12 Exerciſes, dividing them by threes, until I have run over them all, conceiving them ſufficient for the induſtrious to gather from thence matter enough for his intended Exerciſe. And for the more enabling of them, I ſhall endeavour (in theſe curious times) to walk along in as plain a way as poſſibly may be, giving directions unto all Words of Command, for the better performance of the ſame; wiſhing all my loving fellow-Souldiers to conceive well of my good meaning intended to them: deſiring withall to be rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of what part ſoever they fall upon, that they proceed leaſurely and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in the ſame; which will not only be an encouragement unto the Author from whom they gather their Exerciſes, but will bring much praiſes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to themſelves. But to leave every one to their own beſt thoughts, whileſt I proceed to practiſe what before promiſed concerning the ſeveral Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes following.</p>

But by the way, give me leave in this place to tell the Souldiers and Leaders of our private Meetings, that this decorum is not rightly obſerved: the Souldier thinking himſelf wiſer then his Leader, preſumes to chop and change by Counter-marching of his File, making ſome part of the Reer to be more honourable then the Front, which cannot be; for the youngeſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier

there is of more honor then the eldeſt in the Reer, in regard it is the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable part of the <hi>Battalia,</hi> therefore it is plain, that they take more upon them then becomes them; for no File-leader ought to meddle with his File in matter of motions, without conſent of the ſuperior Officers; neither ought the Leader ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through favour, or out of malice, when all the Files are joyned into one compleat Body, to Countermarch the Files, (and after proceeding to other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) depriving thereby the Leaders thereof of their due honour; for elſe, why (juſt in the time of Exerciſe or Marching) ſhould one ſingle File, as the right or left, be Countermarched, if he bore not malice to ſome, thruſting them by this unſouldier-like way out of their places, and through favour or affection often times putting men of little deſert into their places? To leave this diſcourſe, not pleaſing to ſome, let the Commander draw forth one File of Pikes, and double it by the Half-file, and ſend a Serjeant to fetch the Colours; and after cloſing his Ranks and Files to <hi>Order,</hi> he may begin to make ſome alteration in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing of them in their Motions, ſpending his time altogether upon <hi>Inverſion</hi> and <hi>Converſion.</hi>

                     <p>HE that ſhall be deſirous to be truly knowing in this point of <hi>Military Diſcipline,</hi> in the drawing up of Regiments, whether they be of leſſer or greater Bodies, as in ſome 6, others 7, 8, 10, or 12 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, they muſt be drawn up into <hi>Battalia,</hi> either in one, two, or three Squadrons (or grand Diviſions) of Pikes flanked with Muskettiers, having always in the Reer a ſufficient number of Muskettiers for the guard of the Bagage, Cannon, or to be Convoys for to convey Ammunition and Victual to the reſt of their fellows; who are to be drawn forth (by the diſcretion of the Major) from each particular Company, according to their ſeveral ſtrengths, as in greater Companies more Files then in thoſe which be leſſer, ordering them timely relief, whereby the ſeveral duties amongſt the Souldiers throughout the Regiment by an equal way may take their turns. Now for as much as the true ſtating of the Dignities of every particular Officer, in the opinions of many, differ very much, and our former Military Authors have been very ſparing in their pains in ſetting down their due places of honour; I ſhall, for ſatisfaction of thoſe which deſire to be rightly informed, collect out of the many forms practiſed abroad and at home, one good way to perfect it.</p>
                     <p>But here, by the way, I muſt crave pardon from the courteous Reader, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I foreſee certain Objections like rubs or blocks lying in my way, to digreſs a little from my intended purpoſe, to give anſwers unto each of them: which are,</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it will be a means to occaſion much idleneſs in the Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is too great a knowledge to be laid open to their view.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt I anſwer, That the reaſon, as I conceive, why they have been ſo ſparing of their pains in this kind, was not for want of Abilities or knowledge amongſt any of them, whoſe works for the moſt part I highly honour and eſteem, but rather believe that they left it forth for the curious ſearch of ſuch who are called unto <hi>Field-Officers</hi> places, knowing well, that before they are capable of that preferment, they muſt be good proficients in this part of <hi>Military Exerciſe.</hi>

                     <p>The opinions of Souldiers in the drawing up of Regiments are very various both in their Forms and Figures, according to the cuſtom of their Countreys, commands of their Generals, or Officers in chief, which nevertheleſs may prove very good and ſerviceable when need ſhall require.

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The manner of drawing up a Regiment conſiſting of ſix Companies, containing in it a <hi>Colonel,</hi> a <hi>Lieutenant-Colonel,</hi> a <hi>Major,</hi> and three <hi>Captains,</hi> every one having <hi>108</hi> men in a Company, and the three Field-Officers <hi>144.</hi> which makes compleatly up <hi>756</hi> men, whereof two thirds are Muskettiers, and one third of Pikes, the Files being ſix deep.</head>
                     <p>THe general place of Rendezvous being appointed out unto the Major, it is his care to take a timely view thereof, that there be ground and room ſufficient enough for the drawing them up. And having received Orders from his Colonel, Major General, or other ſuperiour Officers for the Regiments marching thither, he may appoint the Companies to march either of theſe two ways, either by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion or dignity. If by ſucceſſion, firſt the Colonels Company moves away; next the Lieutenant Colonels in the Reer of him; then the Majors, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all the reſt from the eldeſt to the youngeſt, who brings up the Reer of all. If by Dignity, firſt the Colonels Company; and in the Reer of him, the youngeſt Captain; and after him the eldeſt; then the Majors; then the ſecond Captain; the Lieutenant Colonel bringing up the Reer of all. But it concerns the Major before their marching to give notice to the Lieutenant Colonel and the eldeſt Captain to countermarch their Ranks of their two particular Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as ſoon as they come into the place of the general Rendezvous before he ſhall draw them up, to preſerve the honour of the right File-leaders, and Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers up of both Arms. He is likewiſe to be there beforehand, attending their marching in, and after the Colonels Company have made Alt, to draw up each particular Company on the left of him, all in one even range, commanding them to cloſe Ranks forward to Order, and Files into the midſt unto the ſame diſtance. He is likewiſe to inform himſelf of the Captains, Lieutenants, and Serjeants, how many Files of Pikes and Muskettiers they have in each particular Company, and accordingly he is to enter it down in his Paper-Book, and to make uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as followeth.</p>
                     <p>He is to require one ſingle File apiece of Muskettiers to be drawn off from the three ſmalleſt Companies, and two Files apiece from the greater, which makes nine Files, and contains 54 men, which are to be led away by an able Serjeant into the Reer, for to be a guard to the Bagage, or other occaſions. From thence he may proceed, commanding all the Muskettiers to ſtand, and the Pikes to advance their Arms, and move forward ten or twelve paces; and then to ſtand, and cloſe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108706:73"/>
their Files outward to Order; three of their Colours moving with their Pikes to the right hand; the other three moving away to the left. After he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Muskettiers to cloſe their Files outward to Order, and they will ſtand in four Diviſions, two of Pikes, and in the Reer of them, two of Muskettiers, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath is ſet forth; the Captains being all upon the head of the Pikes, with their Enſigns, and the Lieutenants in the Reer; the Serjeants attending upon the Flanks of each diviſion.</p>

                     <p>This being done, command each diviſion of Muskettiers and Pikes to face out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to move to ſuch convenient diſtance, that being faced to the Front, there may be room ſufficient upon the ſubdividing of each diviſion of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers for their moving up, and flanking each body of Pikes. After which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor may aſſign unto every Captain and Lieutenant his due place of honour, as they ſtand all abreſt; and that they may alſo naturally fall into their proper places upon the march, which ſhall be ſet forth in the next Figure ſtanding in two grand Diviſions, the one in the Reer of the other, which may happen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for want of ground; but provided they have ground enough, they ought to ſtand in one even range, as in <hi>folio</hi> 5. The Major, after they are thus drawn up in one even range, will finde three Files of Muskettiers more in the ſecond grand Diviſion, and two of the Pikes, then is in the firſt; therefore he muſt take from thence one File of each Company, and add them to nine Files in the Reer, which maketh them twelve, and then he will have ballanced the diviſions equal, taking off one File of Pikes, and placing it amonſt the eldeſt Captains Pikes.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Reaſons follow for the placing of the Captains, their Colours, and their Lieutenants, after the manner before ſet down.</head>
                     <p>WHat hath formerly been declared concerning a Rank or File, ſix abreſt, or ſix deep, may be ſatisfactory in ſome kind unto this point, which takes his rule from hence. For all private Companies, ſmaller Bodies, or ſingle Files, muſt, or ought to be as neer as they can conformable to greater Bodies, as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, and conſequently they to Brigades. Therefore take notice that this rule ought ever to be obſerved in the drawing of Regiments, that the right Flank, as neer as may be, ought to be ſuitable with the left, both in ſtrength, number, and dignity; and likewiſe to be ſo when they are drawn forth upon a long march, the Front equal with the Reer. Now, ſuppoſe theſe two grand diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtood even abreſt; we will begin to examine the firſt worth, which is the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; and the fourth worth, which is the eldeſt Captains, and placed upon the right and left of the firſt grand diviſion, with the ſecond and third worth, who are the Lieutenant-Colonel and Major, drawn up upon the right and left of the ſecond grand diviſion; and you ſhall finde they are every way equivalent in number, worth and dignity, with that of the firſt.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, there are no more to place, but the fifth and ſixth worth, who are the ſecond and third Captains: and therefore ſince it is the firſt place of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour among the Captains in a Regiment, to lead the firſt Body or Stand of Pikes; it muſt then conſequently follow, that the ſecond place of honour muſt be to lead the ſecond grand diviſion of Pikes; and therefore the fifth worth is brought into and placed between the ſecond and third, that he may ſtand there to lead the ſecond Body of Pikes; wherein the Lieutenant-Colonel, the Major, and his own Colours are placed: ſo that there remains no more but the ſixth worth, or youngeſt Captain to place, who is to be drawn up between the Colonel and eldeſt Captain. Now if we ſhall further proceed to ballance it more cleerly, conſider them by dividing them by two's in their places; as firſt, we will begin with the Colonel, the firſt worth, who hath joyned to him the youngeſt Captain, which is the ſixth worth, and they two make the number (7); then compare the Lieutenant-Colonel, who is the ſecond worth, unto the ſecond Captain joyn'd with him, which is the fifth worth, and they make alike the ſame number; after that compare the Major and elder Captain, who are drawn up into the midſt of the Regiment, whoſe places carry the third and fourth worth, and their number is ſuitable with the reſt. And thus much may be ſpoken in general: now I ſhall come more particularly to give further ſatisfaction, both for them, and for all the reſt; and therefore I will give reaſons for the placing of the Officers of the firſt grand diviſion; and cleering that, the ſecond will quickly be laid open to the view.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> More particular Reaſons for the placing of the Captains and Lieutenants of the firſt grand Diviſion.</head>
                     <p>IN this grand Diviſion, there is the Colonel, the eldeſt Captain, and the youngeſt drawn up into the midſt, and they having each of them Lieutenants; take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice therefore of theſe reaſons for their placing thus; That always upon ſuch ſmall Bodies as theſe, the firſt honour is ever placed upon the right, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond upon the left; and that which remains, muſt of neceſſity be drawn up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the midſt; they ſtanding all abreſt. Theſe three Companies being ordered into a right and left Flank, and one Stand of Pikes, or Van-guard, Reer-ward, or Main-battail, as they may be term'd, the reaſons follow for the thus ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Officers, whether marching all even abreſt, or upon a ſtand: it is the Colonels proper place to be on the head or midſt of his grand diviſion; which is his chiefeſt place of ſecurity, and where he ought to fight; for ſtanding there, the other may more conveniently repair unto him for their orders, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall require. Now the Colonel being a Field-Officer, is not abſolutely tyed to any one place to fight, as the reſt are, many occaſions calling him from
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108706:74"/>
thence; the eldeſt Captain therefore is appointed to take charge of the Body of Pikes, whether it be upon a March to lead them, or upon a Stand to fight them, he ought never to forſake them, but upon ſpecial command from his Colonel, or other Field-Officers. Now the reaſon why the firſt Body of Pikes is the moſt honourableſt place to lead, is, as I conceive, becauſe the Colonels Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are there flying; and beſides, being the more ancienter Arms, far more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it is to lead them; for moſt commonly the gallanteſt men of the Infantry deſire rather to trail Pikes, then to carry Muskets. Moreover, it hath been a conſtant practiſe in moſt places, that the eldeſt Captain ſhould have that place to lead on foot, although many times his Colonel being on horſe-back, may be a little before him. Having ſpoken of theſe two, it remains to ſpeak ſomething of the youngeſt Captain, who is appointed either upon the Marching all abreſt, or upon a Stand, to take charge of the Reer-ward, or left Flank of the firſt grand Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to fight them; but upon the long March, it is more honourable for him to fall down in the Reer, and to bring up his own Lieutenant, coming up into his place; for it is greater honour (though many times not believed) to bring up a grand diviſion, then to lead a Sub-diviſion. In the next place, it may be ſuppoſed that the Captain-Lieutenants place is too honourable to lead the Van-guard. To which I anſwer, That the Colonel himſelf is confined thither; for upon the long March he draws off the Van-guard, and leads them himſelf, being attended on horſe-back by the Martial and Quarter-maſter of his own Regiment. Now lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Muskettiers of his own particular Company, the Captain-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being ſubſervient unto him, marcheth a foot upon the head of the firſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Muskettiers, and takes charge of them, as aſſiſting to his Colonel, and fighting them, if he receives no command to the contrary, when they are all drawn up again even abreſt, it concerning him eſpecially to be there reſident in the abſence of his Colonel, for the better regulating of them. The eldeſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Lieutenant is always placed in the Reer of the Pikes, either upon a Stand, or upon a March, it being very honourable unto him to bring up a grand Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pikes. The third Captains Lieutenant is ordered to bring up the left Flank, except it be upon the long March, and then he is to exchange places with his own Captain. There is yet one place vacant, which is to bring up the right Flank; and the Captain-Lieutenants Bringer-up many times through courteſie is called a Lieutenant, therefore a Major may be ſo courteous as to aſſign him that place. And here I ſhall conclude with the reaſons of the places of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the firſt grand Diviſion.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Reaſons for the placing of the Officers of the ſecond grand Diviſion.</head>
                     <p>ALthough the Colonel is Commander in chief, yet his diſcretion is ſuch, as to leave the ordering of places to his Major; and as he takes charge of the firſt grand Diviſion, ſo he leaves the ſecond to his Lieutenant-Colonel, who ſtands upon the head or midſt of the ſame, being drawn up all even abreſt; and many times leads the ſecond grand Diviſion, as the Colonel doth the firſt, as was the practiſe in the Regiments upon their March under the command of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> General of the Parliaments Forces. To ſuch as ſhall approve of this way (which may be very good) they ſhall not need to Counter-march the Ranks of the Lieutenant-Colonel, as is before expreſſed, before the drawing up of the Lieutenant-Colonels Company, but draw them up on the right of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and to Counter-march the Ranks of the Majors, and draw his Company up on the left. But I ſhall leave that to the liberty of thoſe that ſhall beſt fancie this kinde, and proceed to that which is of more uſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond grand Diviſion ſtanding in an even range with the firſt, it will be convenient for the Lieutenant-Colonel to be upon the head thereof. As concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Major, he being an Officer at will, hath no certain place aſſign'd unto him, by reaſon of his moving as occaſion ſhall require to both Diviſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108706:75"/>
he may give orders unto them all, minding the good order of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment throughout every part. But if he will take his place, to march in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt place for him, if they march all abreſt, will be in the Front, between the Colonel and Lieutenant-Colonel; but in the long march, in the midſt of both grand Diviſions, whereby he may have freer acceſs unto them both, whoſe vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eye in the well ordering of the Regiment is chiefly concern'd, obſerving all the paſſages, whether there be need of ſub-dividing their Diviſions; and if at any time they ſhall be divided, when there is ground ſufficient enough, he muſt give order again for the drawing them all up even abreſt, it being far more graceful to the Regiments marching. In the next place, the ſecond Captain may claim it as his due, to lead the ſecond Body of Pikes, as the eldeſt Captain challengeth the firſt; and the reaſon given for his place, may ſuffice for both. The eldeſt Lieutenant in this grand Diviſion, which is the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieutenant, is aſſigned unto that place, where he is ſet down for to be an aſſiſtant there unto his Lieutenant-Colonel, for the well regulating of his men which march in the Reer, as the Captain-Lieutenant is to the Colonels men, who march in the Front; and his Lieutenant-Colonel bringing up the whole Regiment, is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place of honour. Some may conceive the Majors Lieutenant hath too great a place of honour in leading the Van of the ſecond grand Diviſion. To which I anſwer, If the Lieutenant-Colonel marcheth not there himſelf, but ſhall bring up the Regiment; certainly it muſt be cleer, that it is the Majors due, for to march there himſelf at times convenient; and being ſo, there is good reaſon in his abſence his Lieutenant ſhould lead his men, or in his preſence to be there as a helper unto him, for the well regulating of his men, as the other Lieutenants are to the other Field-Officers, who every one of them according to their ſeveral places may have ſeveral occaſions to call them off; their Lieutenants therefore ought to be at hand, and to march with them in their places, whereby they may receive Orders from them, and know how to act in their abſence concerning their own particular Souldiers. The ſecond Captains Lieutenant is ordered to bring up the ſecond Body of Pikes; which being a grand Diviſion, it falls to him as due there, as the eldeſt Captains Lieutenant doth in the firſt, it being the greateſt place of honour that can be given him in the Reer, next to the Lieutenant-Colonel. Having ſpoken thus much concerning every Field-Officer, the Captains and their Lieutenants, where their places are to march, with the reaſons for the ſame, it will be expected to ſupply two places which are vacant in the Reer of the ſecond grand diviſion. To which I anſwer, Upon the long march the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonel himſelf moves down there, and brings up the Reer of the whole Regiment; and therefore it is left vacant for him. But then you will ſay, There wants an Officer to bring up the Reer of that Diviſion wherein the Majors Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant is placed. To which I anſwer, That there is none remaining to do it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be the Majors Lieutenant himſelf. For if the Major ſhall lead the ſecond grand Diviſion, then his Lieutenant may move down to bring up that particular Diviſion for to ſupply the ſame; but in regard the Major (as hath been ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) hath many occaſions to call him off, it concerns his Lieutenant to keep his place which was firſt aſſigned unto him, to avoid the trouble of moving up again in his Majors abſence. Some are of opinion it would be convenient to place the Lieutenant-Colonels eldeſt Serjeant there; but in my judgement, it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome to ſee any Halberdeer, either to lead or bring up any Diviſion march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Regimental way; and rather then I ſhould do it, I would let it go unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; but if he ſhall be there placed to bring up, his beſt way of marching is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Pallizado, or half-pike, and not with his Halberd.</p>

from him. The Souldiers being warned thereby, begin to ſhoulder their Arms, and prepare to move; the Colonel on Horsback being attended on by his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Quarter-maſter, draws off the firſt Diviſion of Muskettiers, his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Lieutenant being ſix foot behinde him; which Diviſion is brought up by the Captain-Lieutenants Bringer-up. The eldeſt Captain follows next, leading the firſt Diviſion of Pikes, and brought up by his own Lieutenant. The next Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Muskettiers is led by the third Captains Lieutenant, and the Reer of the firſt grand Diviſion is brought up by the third Captain. There ought to be full 18 foot of ground betwixt each Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; he that brings up a Diviſion, ought to be cleer ſix foot behinde the ſame; and he that leads, to be ſix foot before; ſo that there will be ſix foot proportion of ground betwixt them both, for the better diſtinguiſhing of their Diviſions, the Leaders and Bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers-up thereof. And where there is not room ſufficient for the marching ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abreſt, as they are now ordered, they muſt ſubdivide, being careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Diviſions, marching in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter depths, at their due diſtance of open order in rank, and order in file. For the Serjeants muſt not preſume upon any ſub-dividing to bring them down in the Reer of them that march before, and keep them intire in all their reſpective Diviſions. And it muſt be their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to attend upon the Flanks, even abreſt with thoſe Leaders of Files that were taken off; that when there is ground and room enough, they more readier know where to finde them, and to lead them up again as they were at firſt. Care likewiſe muſt be had upon any ſub-dividing of the Pikes, that there be none of the Colours divided, who are in a Regimental way to march all three together, according to their firſt placing. Theſe rules and obſervations concern both grand Diviſions. Now the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led away, as is before expreſt, there ought to be ſufficient ground betwixt each grand Diviſion for the leading of the Carriages; and in the firſt place there is to be conſidered, that to moſt Regiments there is allowed two Waggons, for the Baggage and Ammunition, and two Field-pieces, or great Cannon, beſides other Carriages which more concern the Victual for the Souldiers, as occaſion ſhall require: now concerning the ordering, and ſecureſt placing of all theſe upon the March, will be in the midſt of the Regiment, and to have thoſe which are ordred for their Guard, to be Fire-locks, or to have Snap-hances, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of the danger which might happen by the Cole of the Match; and being placed where any attempt of the Enemy ſhall fall on, either to Front, Reer, or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108706:76"/>
either Flank, the Cannon may thus be eaſily drawn forth to fire upon them; and all the wood of the Carriages, with their Guard, to be ordred in the Reer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the aſſault ſhould happen, for their better ſecurity and ſafety. The Major in the next place, if he pleaſe, may lead the ſecond grand Diviſion; to which purpoſe he draws off (with the aſſiſtance of his own Lieutenant) the firſt Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Muskettiers, his Lieutenant being ſix foot behinde him, and ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Muskettiers. The next that follows, is the ſecond Body of Pikes, which is led by the ſecond Captain, and brought up by his own Lieutenant. The laſt Diviſion of Muskettiers is led by the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieutenant: and the Reer of the whole Regiment is brought up by the Lieutenant-Colonel. The Serjeants are to march upon the Flanks, attending their own men, that when they are to be reduced into Companies, they may know more readier where to finde them; and according to order they may draw them off to compleat up their Captains Companies. As for the Drums, the care thereof belongs to the Drum-Major to place, and to eaſe them timely by reliefs, to beat as many or as few as he ſhall think fit; to which purpoſe, he orders them to fall in betwixt the ſecond and third Rank of Muskettiers and Pikes of each Diviſion; but when they are all even abreſt, the Drums are placed according as you ſee them marked.

                     <p>Before the Major ſhall begin his Exerciſe, he ſhall do well to appoint unto each Diviſion, the Captains and their Enſigns, (whoſe Colours in the mean time may be ſtuck in the ground, or given to any of the File-leaders of Pikes, to hold du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of Exerciſe) to take charge of them, to order them according unto every word of command, and the Lieutenant and Serjeants to each Diviſion of Muskettiers, that after ſilence is craved throughout the whole Regiment, the Major by ſtretching out his voice in every word of Command, the reſt as his Eccho are immediately to give it out along the whole Front, and from thence unto the Reer, and every Officer to lead his men accordingly.</p>
                     <p>The Major having ſtated all things according to the former directions, may if he pleaſe, either face, double, counter-march, or wheel, to Front, Reer, or both Flanks in every particular Diviſion; And may after fire them by way of Diviſions
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108706:76"/>
drawn off ten or twenty paces before the Front, firing them 7 or 8 times over, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them by other ſupplies, marching up into their ground. And may after face the Reer-diviſions about, and fire them to Front and Reer on the ſame ground they ſtand, there being ſufficient intervalls for their wheeling off in the Reer of themſelves. And after ſeveral firings in this kinde, the Pikes may charge on; but before they begin their firings, the Pikes muſt cloſe into the midſt to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Muskettiers to cloſe their Pikes to open order, and every Diviſion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo much ground betwixt each other for their conveniencie, that after firing they may wheel off.</p>
                     <p>Now if you will fire, or skirmiſh the one with the other, then draw off the Reer, or ſecond grand Diviſion, and move them away, and draw them up in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition 100 foot diſtance of ground betwixt each Front, and let the Lieutenant-Colonels Company be drawn up upon the right, and the Majors upon the left of that grand Diviſion, that it may carry ſome anſwerableneſs with that of the Colonels. The Muskettiers having ſix foot interval of ground betwixt each other before they begin to fire, they may continue their firings of this nature, as long as they pleaſe, and the Pikes may after charge on to ſuch convenient diſtance, as that they come not within three Pikes length one of another, for avoiding doing hurt the one to the other, the Muskettiers ſtill continuing their firing, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Reer of themſelves; and when they come within diſtance, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent above knee-height, for the above-named reaſons. Now the Souldiers being almoſt tired, and all their Powder ſpent, and retreating from each other, that ſide which falls out to be ſtrongeſt, (as being the Colonels grand Diviſion or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) may beat a parley, to invite the weaker to come in to mercy, offering them all fair Quarter, provided they timely and preſently receive it, and that they will cheerfully and willingly go along with them, and never any more revolt, but be on their ſide, to fight with them upon all juſt occaſions, as ſhall be required. After which, the Lieutenant-Colonel yeilding, they may wheel about, and march into the ſame ground from whence they were firſt drawn forth, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the ſame order and condition as they were before they began to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. And thus much ſhall ſuffice concerning the ordinary plain way of exerciſing of Regiments: but thoſe that ſhall deſire a little more curioſity, they may obſerve ſuch Exerciſes as in the next place ſhall be ſet forth unto them.</p>

                     <p>IT might be expected after Doublings, that I ſhould ſhew ſome kinds of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarches amongſt the Military Motions, in the exerciſe of a Regiment; but being of very little uſe or practiſe amongſt Commanders in theſe times, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch great Bodies; and for my own part, I fancy them not, therefore have paſſed them over, and pitcht upon ſuch wheelings, which by ſome are accounted Countermarches. Whoſe judgements my deſire is better to inform by theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſons following, wherein, and in what kind they differ from them. As thus: by theſe wheelings, they keep their diſtance in Rank and File unto Order, and wheeling entire unto any hand down to the Reer, cannot be performed but by gaining in the Motion before the Front, and unto all places as they move, ſo much ground as is the Length of their particular Diviſions; and in the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they ſtill preſerve the honour of the right and left-hand-file-leaders, and all others as are concerned in their particular Diviſions, unto any accidental Front which they ſhall be brought unto. Now concerning Countermarches, they are to be performed either by ſingle Files, Ranks, Half-files, or Half-ranks, and at their diſtance of Open Order, their words of Command having relation to all theſe particulars. Their Countermarching of Files to the Reer gaineth no ground before the Front in the Motion, but only the room of one particular File upon the right; it preſerveth not the honour of the right and left-hand-file-leader at one time by any one word of Command

unto any of their Motions to ſuch accidental Fronts they ſhall make, but ever loſeth it to ſome, and giveth it to others. And therefore it may appear cleerly unto any ingenious capacity, that the former Wheelings cannot be accounted, or given in their Motions in that kinde to the Souldiers for Counter-marches, but by ſuch terms as in their place are ſet down. In the next place, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of the great benefit or uſe that may be made of theſe ſorts of Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: as firſt, a Commander may uſe them in the Motions of Doublings to Front, Reer, right-flank, or left, or double either the length or depth of the Battail unto all needful places, as occaſion ſhall require; which I ſhall forbear to ſet down, but leave them to the diſcretion of the ingenious Souldiers practiſe, when time and opportunity ſhall ſerve him to make uſe of them. In the next place, they are very neceſſary to draw off any part, and to bring them unto ſuch need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful places for Service, as are in eminent danger. Therefore paſſing over for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent what might be more ſpoken of in this kinde, I come in the next place to ſhew one Figure of Battail to fire upon; and then conclude my Exerciſe upon this Regiment, and go on unto the reſt.</p>

I ſhall therefore for the better ſatisfaction of ſuch as remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skill'd herein, go through them all, partly to ſhew the practiſe of this our City in their ſeveral drawings up, with the reaſons to confirm the ſame. And having paſſed over as much as is convenient, to ſatisfie any ingenious Souldier concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the drawing up of ſix Companies in a Regimental-way, with the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reaſons of every particular Officer, as he there ſtands, it may in many things give full light to this that follows of ſeven Companies. Yet nevertheleſs, for more fuller ſatisfaction herein, I ſhall ſhew the true manner hereof, that I may not be wanting to any Souldiers benefit that he ſhall receive thereby. Where note, for better Order herein, that I have pitcht upon a particular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, although it may many times fall out ſo, that the Captains Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and the Field-Officers cannot be ſo full as I have here ſet down. Or again, it may chance to fall out (as in our Trained Bands of <hi>London</hi>) that they be a great deal fuller, as ſometimes they are; for I have led a particular Company my ſelf upon a general day, being drawn into the Filed conſiſting of above 300 men. Yet nevertheleſs, whether the Companies be great or ſmall, obſerve this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule; make two grand Diviſions, and ballance their number equal in both Arms, and make no more Sub-diviſions then what you have Captains to lead, and Lieutenants to bring up; and let the Serjeants march by the Flanks, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108706:80"/>
not preſume either to lead, or bring up any diviſions, being conceived by moſt to be very improper. And again, if you fight the Regiment, let your Muskettiers as neer as you can be equal alike in their Sub-diviſions, as they may moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently fall out, whether four, five, or ſix abreſt, it makes no great matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways leaving in time of fight, between ſuch numbers of Files, ſix foot of ground interval, for to wheel off their Ranks after they have fired.</p>
                     <p>Now, ſuppoſe the whole Regiment were marching to their general place of Randezvous; the Major being there beforehand, attending the Companies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, he Orders to the Colonels Company the moſt convenient place for their drawing up; and next to him, the fourth Captains Company upon the left; and next to him, the third Captain; and after him, the eldeſt or firſt Captain, which makes the firſt grand Diviſion. In the next place, he orders the Lieutenant-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels Company to be on the left of the whole Regiment, ſtanding in even Front with the Colonel; upon the right of him, the ſecond Captain is placed, and after him the Majors own Company, which make up the ſecond grand Diviſion.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far proceeded, let the Major command the Pikes and Colours to advance forward ten paces, before the Front of Muskettiers; then let him cloſe the Pikes of the firſt four Companies to the right to Order, and the Pikes of the laſt to the left to Order, and the like of the Muskettiers in the Reer to thoſe hands, to the ſame diſtance; then they will ſtand in four Diviſions; two of Pikes in the Front, and two of Muskettiers in the Reer. In the next place, let him count how many Files of Pikes there are in each Diviſion, and he will finde in the Colonels Diviſions 26 Files, and in the Lieutenant-Colonels but twenty two. To make theſe even, he muſt take off one File apiece from the youngeſt Captains, and bring them into the midſt of the Lieutenant-Colonels Diviſion; and then he will make them equal, there being in each grand Diviſion 24 Files of Pikes. The Pikes being made thus equal, let him move down into the Reer, and examine the Muskettiers; where upon the right he will finde 52 Files, and upon the left but 44; to make theſe even in number, he muſt take off one File apiece from the four Companies of the firſt grand Diviſion, and lead them away up into the midſt of the ſecond; and then there will be in each grand Diviſion of Muskettiers 48 Files apiece. In the next place, let him face them to the right and left outward, and move them to ſuch convenient diſtance, as he may after divide his Muskettiers into four Diviſions to move up, and flank the Pikes.</p>
                     <p>This being performed, he ought appoint unto every Captain and Lieutenant his place where to lead, and where to bring up, and what men upon all occaſions they are to fight. To which purpoſe, there being in the firſt grand Diviſion four Captains, there muſt be four places to lead, and four to bring up; and therefore having their four Colours upon the long March, that Body of Pikes may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two Diviſions, and to march with two Colours in the firſt Diviſion of Pikes, which are to be led by the eldeſt Captain, and brought up by the Captain-Lieutenants Bringer-up. The ſecond Diviſion of Pikes is to be led by the fourth Captain, and to be brought up by the eldeſt Captain-Lieutenant. The Reer-guard of Muskettiers in this grand Diviſion, is to be led by the third Captain, and to be brought up by his Lieutenant; who upon the long March, his Captain if he pleaſeth, may exchange places, being more honour to him to be there to bring up, then to lead that Diviſion, as hath been formerly expreſt. As concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Captain-Lieutenant, his place is to be fixed according as in the Figure to lead the firſt Diviſion of Muskettiers, and to be brought up by the fourth Captains Lieutenant: but at ſuch time when they are drawn up all abreſt, they are to take their places as at firſt fixed, both in their leading and bringing-up, as ſhall be ſet forth in the following Figure, with all their ſeveral places appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. As concerning all the reſt, they are placed in manner as was ſhewed in my diſcourſe of a Regiment conſiſting of ſix Companies.</p>
                     <p>But here it may be objected, that in the firſt grand Diviſion I have placed the Colonel, eldeſt Captain, third and fourth, and by caſting up their number of dignity, we finde it to amount unto 18; and in the ſecond grand Diviſion,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108706:80"/>
the Lieutenant-Colonel, Major and ſecond Captain, whoſe number amounts but to ten. Here we finde (ſay they) a great deal of difference and alteration, your intentions principally tending to make them equal in dignity; for certainly, where the greater number is, there is the leſſer dignity; and therefore a wrong unto that part where ever it ſo falls out.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, Where there is no juſt exceptions to be made to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the former Rule ought ever to be preſerved in the keeping an equal ballance of the number of dignity; but herein it doth not: For the Colonel ought always to have placed in his Diviſion the eldeſt Captain, who is to lead his Colours, and the firſt Body of Pikes, which is the firſt place of honour among the Captains: And in the ſecond place, the Majors Company is always drawn up upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part, on the right of the Lieutenant-Colonels grand Diviſion, to carry an equal proportion of number, they being the ſecond and third worth unto that of the firſt or fourth, as is in the Colonels. In the next place, the ſecond Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains turn comes to be regarded, who by the ſame Rule, as the eldeſt Captain layes claim to carry the firſt honour, by leading the firſt Body of Pikes, and the Colonels Colours; ſo the ſecond Captain cannot expect any other, but to be placed to lead the ſecond Body of Pikes, &amp; the Lieutenant-Colonels Colours. Now there being an odd Captain, he muſt be either placed upon the right or left; he is therefore thought in diſcretion to be rather placed with the Colonel in his Diviſion, that his Colours may there flie, marching four together, being far more honourable and graceful then that of three, as in the Lieutenant-Colonels; and therefore where there is an honour in that kinde which cannot be divided, it is very fit and requiſite to place and fix it with him that is the Commander in chief. As for number of men, both Diviſions are equal alike; and therefore, I conceive, what hath been ſpoken may take off all objections of this nature.</p>
                     <p>And now according to my promiſe, I ſhall ſet forth the manner of the ſtanding of ſeven Companies in a Regimental way, with all the ſeveral places of honour appointed forth unto them, either marching, or ſtanding all even abreſt: If they be upon the long march, they are to obſerve that manner ſet down in ſix Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, onely to minde that alteration before expreſſed: the Figure of their draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and the Officers ſtated in their proper places, follows in Folio 156.</p>
                     <p>From which Figure I ſhall draw up another, placing the Souldiers in Battalia, which may be uſeful for them to fight-upon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Command.</hi> Pikes in both Diviſions, face inward, inmoſt Diviſions of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers face outward, march, and interchange ground with other; face to your Leader. The four inmoſt Files of Muskettiers next the Pikes,<note place="margin">Let them be at open Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their Ranks and Files, and the two grand Diviſions ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one even Front together.</note> face about, and march ſix foot cleer from the Pikes, and ſtand; then cloſe their Files to the right and left to Order, in their own particular diviſions; then face inward, and march all together, until they ſtand ſix foot cleer of each other; face to your Leader. The next five Files of Muskettiers in each ſide of Pikes, advance 18 foot before the Front; then cloſe their Files into the midſt to Order, and Ranks forward to Order; Pikes, cloſe your Ranks forward to Order, and Files into the midſt to Order: every five Files of Muskettiers cloſe inward to Order, and Ranks forward to Order; then face to the Pikes, and march forward, being betwixt every five Files of Muskettiers ſix foot of ground diſtance each from other, and the ſame diſtance from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of Pikes; face all to your Leader. The 12 outmoſt Files of Pikes and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers, advance forward ſix foot cleer of the ſtanding part; then move forward the three outmoſt diviſions of Muskettiers 12 paces; then face them inward, and move them until they ſtand ſtreight before the five remaining diviſions; face all to your Leader. The middle-diviſion of Muskettiers of thoſe three taken off before from each Flank, move forward ſix foot cleer of the ſtanding part; the three middlemoſt diviſions of the five remaining upon each Flank, move up until you ſtand ſix foot ſhort of the diviſions which are before you; the two outmoſt diviſions of the laſt three that moved, face outward, and march ſix foot cleer of the former diviſions between them: The two remaining diviſions by the outſide
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108706:81"/>
of Pikes move inward, until you ſtand ſtreight in the Reer with the two Front-diviſions, facing all to their Leader, they will ſtand as is ſet forth unto your view in Folio 156.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the former directions of drawing forth the Figure, make this alteration; wheel off the firſt two diviſions of Muskettiers before the Pikes, and place them ſix foot behind the Reer of thoſe upon the Flanks, and before you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, carry them into their firſt places.</p>
                     <p>In this Figure you have Forlorns, aptly ſtanding to the Wings and main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Pikes, with Reſerves to them all, ſo that I ſhall not need to trouble my ſelf for to deſcribe what firings might be here performed upon the ſame, they ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo apparent to the view; the diviſions being cleer each of other, any inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Commander may fire them according unto his own beſt diſcretion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the ſame as long as he ſhall think fitting; and therefore paſſing it by, and leaving it to their own liberty, I come in the next place to reduce them again into private Companies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reducement.</hi> Pikes of the main Body, advance forward, and range even abreſt with the Pikes before you; the two laſt diviſions of Muskettiers in the Reer move up, and Flank the Pikes; the two diviſions of Muskettiers before the Front, face about, and move down upon the right and left of the other two diviſions of Muskettiers; to your Leader. The two laſt diviſions of Muskettiers in the Reer of the Flanks, advance forward to the right and left, and range even abreſt on the outſide of thoſe three diviſions that ſtands before you: Single diviſions of Muskettiers in the Front of each Wing, face about, and move down even abreſt with the Reer of the next diviſions. The eight diviſions of Muskettiers upon each Wing, face about; the five firſt Diviſions move down, and range even abreſt with the Reer; the three laſt move to the right, and left outward, until you be cleer of the reſt; face to the Reer, and move down in like manner, and Rank even with the reſt; after face all to the Front, and they will all ſtand in one even Front. Next command the Pikes to face outward, and the five inmoſt diviſions of Muskettiers in each Flank, face inward; then march and interchange ground each with other, and face to their Leader; they will ſtand again in two grand Diviſions all even abreſt in the Front. In the next place, let thoſe ſix Files be taken off by the Serjeants of their own Companies from the two grand Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and be brought into their firſt places. After the Major may give order to every Captain to draw off his men, and put them into Companies again, which is eaſily done; after the Regiment may be ordered to march home in ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, either by ſucceſſion or dignity, which he pleaſeth. And here I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude concerning a Regiment of ſeveral Companies.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> The manner of drawing up and placing the Officers of a Regiment conſiſting of eight Companies, having in it a Colonel, a Lieutenant-Colonel, a Major, and five Captains: their number of men in each Company, being equal with the former Regiment, they amount unto <hi>972</hi> men.</head>
                     <p>IT concerns a Major (provided he have room enough) to draw up every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany even abreſt, and to give unto every Captain his due place of honour; after which, he may proceed to order them in a regimental way. Wherefore, briefly thus; obſerve the manner of the Dignity of every Captain, how they ought to be placed, firſt the Colonels Company being drawn up in its convenient place; next to him upon the left ſtands the third Captain; and next to him the fourth; and the next that follows is the eldeſt: theſe four Captains being drawn up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, makes the firſt grand Diviſion; and therefore I ſhall endeavour to give Reaſons for to confirm this, before I ſhall proceed upon the ſecond, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right half-ranks, which ought to carry an equal proportion of Worth, Honour, and Dignity with that of the laſt. Where, firſt, take notice, that the Colonel being the moſt worthieſt man, is placed upon the right, and is the firſt place of Honour; and the outmoſt upon the left is the eldeſt Captain, which is the fourth Worth, there being the Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, and Major above him: now conſider that the firſt and fourth Worth makes the number five; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two is drawn up the third and fourth Captains, which are the ſixth and ſeventh Worth, whoſe number carries 13; add them to that number above, and it makes 18. In the next place, ſince it is the judgement of moſt Souldiers, that there ſhould be an equal proportion of Skill, Valour, and Worth, the Reer-half-files anſwerable to them of the Front: ſo likewiſe the ſame rule is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved between the right and left half-ranks; That whether we conſider the Front-diviſions, or Reer, right or left half-ranks, they may be ſo ballanced in every kind of reſpect, with true proportion; ſo neer as the knowledge of the Souldiers, and number of men will give leave. To which purpoſe, I will proceed to draw up the ſecond grand Diviſion, and compare it to the firſt; The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonels Company being drawn up upon the left of the whole Regiment; upon his right, is the ſecond Captain drawn up; and next to him the fifth Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; after, the Major upon the right of the Lieutenant-Colonels Diviſion. Now, if we conſider, the Lieutenant-Colonel he is the ſecond man of Honour, and therefore ought to be upon the outmoſt part of the Front on the left, when the Companies are marching all even abreſt; but upon the Long-march he is to fall down into the Reer; the outmoſt upon the right of his Diviſion is the Majors Company placed, and he is the third man of Honour. Now the third Worth and ſecond will carry equal ballance of number with that of the firſt and fourth: and ſo have I ſet forth the four firſt places of Honour, which, I ſuppoſe, no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souldier can deny. Betwixt the ſecond and third Worth is drawn up the ſecond Captain and fifth; the ſecond Captain is the fifth Worth, and the fifth Captain is the eighth, which makes the number 13, and will carry an equal weight of number with thoſe in the midſt of the firſt and fourth Worth. Now having ſtated the ſeveral Worths of the ſecond grand Diviſion, being compared together, makes a like number of 18 unto that of the firſt Diviſion. And to take off all Objections that might be made concerning the ſecond Captain and fifth, why they ſhould not rather be placed in the firſt Diviſion, then in the ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath been held by the opinion of ſome, it ſhould be ſo, but never any ſubſtantial reaſon to be given for the ſame: Therefore, unto this I ſhall ſay, that they ought to be there where I have placed them, in reſpect of what I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaid, that as it is the firſt place of Honour amongſt the Captains to lead the firſt Body of Pikes, where the Colonels Colours does flie, and to make them of the ſecond Diviſion equal in number with the firſt; the youngeſt Captain, which is the eighth Worth, is brought in, and joyned to the ſecond Captain, who is the fifth, and therefore a File or a Rank ought to be ſet forth in Dignity after this manner, in reſpect

there is no truer ſtating the Dignity of a ſingle File or Rank, then that which ſhall conform to greater Bodies, as that of Regiments. And thus much briefly ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken concerning the ſecond grand Diviſion, for the placing the ſecond and fifth Captains betwixt the Lieutenant-Colonel and the Majors, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the ſecond Captain ſtands very aptly there to receive his proper place, and the youngeſt Captain is brought in to ballance their Dignities unto that of the firſt.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, I ſhall ſhew how they ought to be drawn up in a Regimental way: being all even abreſt as before, command Muskettiers to face about, and to march down 12 foot clear of the Reer, then face to the Front, after cloſe Files outward to Order of each Arms, then ſubdivide each Diviſion of Muskettiers, and move them up to flank each Body of Pikes. And having accounted and caſt up the number of Files of each Arms in each grand Diviſion, you will finde the Colonels Diviſion to have in it 26 Files of Pikes, and 52 Files of Muskettiers; next the Lieutenant-Colonels Diviſion being examined, you will finde that to have in it 28 Files of Pikes, and 56 Files of Muskettiers. Now to make theſe equal in number, there muſt be taken forth one File of Pikes, and two of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers from the ſecond grand Diviſion, and place one a piece in the midſt of the firſt Diviſion, in every one of their particular Diviſions, and they will contain equal alike in each grand Diviſion 27 Files of Pikes, and 54 Files of Muskettiers. In the next place, the Major may aſſign unto every Captain and Lieutenant where his place ſhall be to lead, and where to bring up; the Colonel being upon the head of his Diviſion, and the Lieutenant-Colonel upon the head of the ſecond grand Diviſion, the Major in the Front betwixt them both, or where elſe he pleaſeth, being an Officer always to act through the whole Regiment. And in the firſt place he appoints the Captain-Lieutenant to be on the head of the firſt Diviſion of Muskettiers, and to be brought up with the fourth Captains Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; next he orders the eldeſt Captain to be on the head of the firſt Diviſion of Pikes, and to be brought up by the Captain-Lieutenants Bringer-up; and the fourth Captain to be on the head of the ſecond diviſion of Pikes, and to be brought up by the eldeſt Captains Lieutenant; and the ſecond diviſion of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers he appoints unto the third Captain, and to be brought up by his own Lieutenant; and upon the Long-march, let him and his Captain change places until ſuch time they ſhall draw up again. After he orders his own Lieutenant to be on the head of the third diviſion of Muskettiers; and the third diviſion of Pikes he appoints to the fifth Captain, and to be brought up by his own Lieutenant; the fourth Diviſion of Pikes is ordered to be the ſecond Captains place, and brought up by his own Lieutenant; the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant is appointed to the fourth and laſt diviſion of Muskettiers, the Lieutenant-Colonel upon the Long-march bringing up the whole Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It might be ſuppoſed the Captain-Lieutenant, Lieutenant-Colonels and Majors Lieutenants have too great places of Honour: but to anſwer them all, their Captains being Field-Officers, and upon ſeveral occaſions moving off, their Lieutenants do officiate there in their rooms, and are but as aſſiſtants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; for likewiſe upon ſeveral occaſions they come to thoſe places them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to lead, marching there before their Lieutenants. As concerning the placing of all the reſt of the other Officers, they lie clearly, for as much as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath been ſpoken in their proper places, without (as I conceive) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of any.</p>

                        </gap>on the Long-march the Colonel draws off the firſt Diviſion of Muskettiers, and leads them, marching ſome 12 foot before his Captain-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and that diviſion is brought up by the fourth Captains Lieutenant, the Colours marching two and two upon every diviſion, whereof the firſt is drawn off and led by the firſt Captain, and brought up by the Captain-Lieutenants Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-up; the next diviſion of Pikes falling in the Reer of the firſt, and led by the fourth Captain, and brought upo the firſt Captains Lieutenant; the ſecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Muskettiers is led by the: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108706:83"/>
his own Captain; the fourth or firſt diviſion of Muskettiers in the ſecond grand Diviſion is led by the Major, when he pleaſeth, ſome 12 foot before his own Lieutenant; and the third Diviſion of Pikes is led by the fifth Captain, and brought up by his own Lieutenant; the fourth and laſt diviſion of Pikes is led by the ſecond Captain, and brought up by his own Lieutenant; the fourth and laſt Diviſion of Muskettiers is led by the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieutenant, the Reer of the whole Regiment being brought up by the Lieutenant-Colonel. Thus every Diviſion is to march by ſucceſſion, the one in the Reer of another, keeping eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen foot diſtance betwixt every Diviſion, until they ſhall have room to march all even abreſt, and then with very little alteration with the third Captain, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging places, with his own Lieutenant, they are all to take their places again, as at firſt.</p>
                     <p>Having now ſet forth the true Dignity of every Captains and Lieutenants place, what men they ſhall take charge on to fight, where to lead, and where to bring up; I ſhall ſpare the Figure in reſpect I ſhall ſhew (with very little alteration) the manner of drawing up and marching of divers Regiments that were under the command of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt grand Diviſion in reſpect of every Officer and place, is to be ordered as the former; only in the ſecond, there will be this ſmall alteration, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Colonels Company and the Majors are to enterchange places, the reſt are to remain as they were, only with this alteration following; the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieutenant is to lead the firſt Diviſion of Muskettiers, until ſuch time that his Lieutenant Colonel ſhall come unto that place; and then he is to bring up that Diviſion being near at hand, that if his Lieutenant-Colonel ſhould upon ſome juſt occaſions be called off, he may immediatly move up, and lead there in his abſence. For upon the Long-march, as the Colonel leads the firſt grand Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, ſo it is conceived by ſome, (they marching in two grand Diviſions ſome twenty paces diſtance from each other in manner of two regimental Marchings) that the Lieutenant-Colonel ought to lead the ſecond. Next, let the Firſt Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Pikes be led by the ſecond Captain, and to be brought up by the fifth Captains Lieutenant; and the ſecond Diviſion of Pikes to be led by the fifth Captain, and brought up by the ſecond Captains Lieutenant; the laſt Diviſion of Muskettiers to be led by the Majors Lieutenant, and the Reer of the ſecond grant Diviſion being left for the Major to bring up, at ſuch time as with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency he may be ſpared. Therefore, to march thus, it being a very good way, and with very little alteration to be made, I was unwilling to paſs it by, leaving it to the diſcretion of every ingenious Souldier, to make uſe of which way he beſt pleaſeth, or likes of, whileſt I in the next place ſhall ſet forth the Figure, which follows in <hi>pag.</hi> 161; affording more variety in the ſame.</p>

                     <p>But, methinks, I hear ſome ſay, Of what uſe or ſervice upon any occaſion may this <hi>Ring</hi> be unto the Souldier? To whom I anſwer, that it is one of the moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable Figures that can be made, to ſecure the Souldier from danger againſt the furious charge of Horſe in <hi>Campania;</hi> the accompliſhing, or making of it up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily and ſuddenly performed, the Muskettiers having Pallizadoes, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance three or four paces, and ſtick them down in ſuch manner, as they may keep the Horſe from breaking in among them. And after, if they ſhould be charged round, they may give fire over them againſt their enemies, and fall in the Reer of themſelves; yet nevertheleſs, if the Horſe ſhould be undaunted, and attempt to come on again, they may reſiſt them with a more deſperate charge after this manner, bringing all hands to fight, and to pour out their ſhot, or to fire altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after this kind. Command firſt the Pikes to move forward, until they be three foot behind the Muskettiers, then let every File rank to the right, which will make them to ſtand but one abreſt in one ſingle <hi>Ring</hi> behind the Muskettiers. Now that all hands may be brought to fight together, command the firſt Rank of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers to kneel down, the ſecond ſtoop, and the third ſtand upright; then let all cloſe forward to cloſe Order, and let the Pikes, as occaſion ſhall require, charge betwixt the Muskettiers, who may fire altogether, and the Pikes may charge on whileſt the Muskettiers make ready again. The Pallizadoes formerly ſtuck, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Horſe from breaking in upon them, they may fire after this manner, as often as they pleaſe. And ſo much may ſuffice to be ſpoken concerning the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and uſe that may be made of it in time of fight; and now in the next place I come to reduce them into Companies again as at firſt.</p>
                     <p>Let the Pikes that ranked to the right, file three to the left as they were, and let the Bringers-up that doubled face about to the right, and march forth into their places. Then let the Major come to that place where he cloſed the <hi>Ring,</hi> and brake it off, wheeling them all along about to the left, until he hath brought them to ſtand in one even Front as at firſt; the ſame in like manner to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Pikes, and to ſtand in the Reer of the Muskettiers. Next, let the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers and Pikes face outward, and move to ſuch convenient diſtance, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Muskettiers may be ſubdivided again, and the Pikes move up, and double their Front inward entire in each grand Diviſion. Which being brought into that form, each Captain may draw off his men, being ſo commanded by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, and compleat up his Company again, and be after diſpoſed of to farther du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or to march home to their Quarters according to command. And here I ſhall conclude this Regiment of eight Companies.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> The manner of drawing up a Regiment conſiſting of ten Companies, having in it ſeven Captains, and three Field-Officers, being in each particular Company the former numbers, which in all amounts unto <hi>1198</hi> men.</head>
                     <p>THe Major having ground ſufficient for the drawing up the Regiment, after the Colonels Company hath made Alt, next to him upon the left he draws up the youngeſt Captain, which is the tenth; and the next to him the third Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which is the ſixth; after that the fourth Captain, which is the ſeventh; then the firſt Captain, which is the fourth: then the Majors, which is the third; next to him the fifth Captain, which is the eighth; and after that the ſecond Captain, which is the fifth; then the ſixth Captain, which is the ninth. All theſe being drawn up upon the left of the Colonels Company, the cloſier of all upon the left, is the Lieutenant-Colonels Company, whoſe figure carries the number 2. Place now all theſe numbers of Dignity according to the former Figures, and they will ſtand as followeth in a Rank.</p>

                     <p>In the next place compare the Dignity of the right Half-ranks with the left, and they are ballanced as neer as can be poſſible to be equal, there being one odd, which of neceſſity muſt be caſt upon the right Half-ranks, for the reaſons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly expreſt, in placing the ſecond Captain into the Lieutenant-Colonels Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. Then according to the former rule, draw forth the Pikes, and ingroſs them into two Bodies, and the like of the Muskettiers; after ſub-divide the Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and make them four diviſions, and move them up to flank the Pikes, and then they will be in two compleat grand Diviſions. In the next place, let the Major order forth unto the Captains and Lieutenants their ſeveral places to lead and to bring up, after this manner. There being two grand Diviſions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in them five Captains, and five Lieutenants, it will be neceſſary to appoint our five ſeveral Charges in the firſt grand Diviſion to lead, and five to bring up, after this manner. As firſt, divide the Van-guard into two Diviſions, the firſt to be led by the Captain-Lieutenant, and brought up by his Bringer-up: the ſecond Diviſion of Muskettiers in the Van to be led by the third Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Lieutenant, and to be brought up by the fourth Captains Lieutenant. The firſt diviſion of Pikes is to have the three firſt Colours to fly upon the head of them, and to be led by the eldeſt Captain, and brought up by the ſeventh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Lieutenant: the next diviſion of Pikes to be led by the fourth Captain, having his own and the eldeſt Captains Colours flying upon the head of them, and to be brought up by the ſeventh, or youngeſt Captain in the Regiment: the Reer-guard of Muskettiers of the firſt grand Diviſion to be led by the third Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and brought up by the eldeſt Captains Lieutenant, who upon the Long-march theſe two are to inter-change places if the third Captain deſire it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch permiſſion from the Major, being more honour to bring up, then to lead, as was ſaid before in the former Regiments.</p>
                     <p>Next follows the placing of the Officers in the ſecond grand Diviſion: let the Van-guard of Muskettiers there be led by the Majors Lieutenant, or by himſelf when he pleaſeth, and be brought up by the fifth Captains Lieutenant: next let the firſt Diviſion of Pikes be led by the fifth Captain; having two Colours flying in the head of them, the Majors, and his own, and to be brought up by the ſixth Captains Lieutenant: let the next Diviſion of Pikes be led by the ſecond Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, having three Colours flying on the head of them, the Lieutenant-Colonels, his own, and the ſixth Captains, and let that be brought up by the ſecond Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Lieutenant: let the laſt Diviſion of Muskettiers be led by the ſixth Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and brought up by the Lieutenant-Colonels Lieutenant; the Lieutenant-Colonel upon the Long-march bringing up the Reer of the Regiment, ſome 12 foot behind his own Lieutenant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:108706:86"/>I ſhall in the next place ſhew the Reaſons for the thus placing of the Officers, where firſt I ſhall endeavour to clear the firſt grand Diviſion, which will occaſion the ſecond to be more eaſily reſolved. Where briefly thus, as concerning the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, eldeſt Captain, third Captain, and Captain-Lieutenant, I ſhall paſs them over, having formerly ſpoken ſufficient to ſatisfie any Souldier therein. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows therefore to ſpeak of the fourth Captains place, which is the next man of Honour after the former, and therefore is placed to lead the ſecond Diviſion of Pikes, which is more honour to him to lead there, then to lead a ſub-diviſion of Muskettiers. In the Van-guard next to him in Honour in this Diviſion, is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Captain, who is appointed to bring up the firſt grand Body of Pikes, which likewiſe is more Honour unto him, then to lead or bring up any ſub-diviſion of Muskettiers; as before expreſſed. Having thus reſolved of all the Captains, and Captain-Lieutenants place, next follows the reaſons of the Lieutenants places; where firſt take notice that the eldeſt Captains Lieutenant is appointed to bring up the Reer-guard, which next the Pikes is the greateſt place of honor in the reer, and a very honorable place unto him; or if he alters places with the third Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon the Long-march, yet nevertheleſs he hath the chiefeſt place of honour after the Capt. Lieut. amongſt all the Lieutenants unto thoſe places he is ordered unto. The third Captains Lieutenant is aſſigned to the next place, who leads the ſecond Diviſion of Muskettiers in the Van-guard, which is more honour to him then to bring up any ſuch Diviſion; after follows him the fourth Captains Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, who brings up the Reer of the Van-guard, which is more honour to him, of the places remaining, to be there, then to bring up either the firſt Diviſion of Muskettiers, or the firſt Diviſion of Pikes. Laſtly, the ſeventh Captains Lieutenant is placed to bring up the firſt Diviſion of Pikes, which being the more honourable Arms, it adds more honour to him to be there to bring up, then the firſt Diviſion of Muskettiers, which being the laſt place of honour, it is given to the Captain-Lieutenants Bringer-up to be there. And thus much ſhall ſuffice for the reaſons of the places of the firſt grand Diviſion.</p>
                     <p>Now for placing of the Officers of the ſecond grand Diviſion, I ſhall not need to ſpeak any thing concerning the Lieutenant-Colonels Major, Second Captain, and the Majors Lieutenants place, in regard in the former Regiments I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to give the Souldier ſatisfaction therein. Therefore next to thoſe in this grand Diviſion follows to be ſpoken is the fifth Captain, who is the next man of honour, and therefore hath his due place appointed out to him to lead the firſt diviſion of Pikes, where the Majors and his own <hi>Colours</hi> flie, which is more honour to him to lead there the Van of the Pikes, then the Reer-guard of Muskettiers. Next to him is the ſixth Captain, which next the Pikes hath his due place of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour remaining to him to lead the Reer-guard. Having thus reſolved the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains places, I ſhall in the next endeavour to ſhew the Lieutenants, where firſt it falls to the Lieut. Colonels Lieutenant to be placed firſt, who is ordered to bring up the Reer, to be an aſſiſtant unto his Lieut. Colonel, who is a Field-Officer, and may have many occaſions to fall off, and therefore he requires his Lieutenant to be preſent with his men there, as the Colonels doth his in the Front. And as much may be ſaid of the Majors Lieutenant, but paſſing him by, I come next to the ſecond Captains Lieutenant, who is appointed to bring up the Reer of the ſecond Body of Pikes, which is the greateſt place of honour that is in the Reer next to the Lieu. Colonels Lieutenant. After him follows the fifth Captains Lieutenant, who is placed to bring up the Reer of the Van-guard of this diviſion, which is more honor then to bring up the Van of the Pikes, whoſe turn being the laſt place of honor, fals to him that is the youngeſt Lieutenant, which is the ſixth Captains Lieutenant.:</p>
                     <p>And thus as briefly as I could I have run over all the reaſons for the placing of the Officers in the Regiment drawn up after this manner, that I might not be wanting unto the deſire of any ſuch who are willing to be informed therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always ready to employ my ſelf in as plain a way as I can for the benefit of all true loving Souldiers, who are concerned herein. And therefore, for their better ſatisfaction, let them caſt their eye upon the Figure, as it is demonſtrated between <hi>Folio</hi> 161 and 162, where they ſhall ſee every man placed according to my former Diſcourſe.</p>

XVII.</hi> The manner both of the drawing up, and the order of the Long-march of Colonel <hi>Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> his Regiment, bringing up the Reer of the Foot of the Army under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Lord General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> at their firſt marching through the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> on the ſeventh of <hi>Auguſt, 1647.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe firſt order of drawing up the Regiment at their firſt place of Rande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, before they marched or joyn'd with the Army, was thus: The Colonels Company being upon the out-moſt part of the right of the Regiment; next to his left by ſucceſſion was drawn up the ſecond, ſixth, fifth, and firſt Captain, which make up his Diviſion, or the right Half-ranks in their firſt drawing up to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and may in their Figure of Dignity ſtanding in a rank be demonſtrated as followeth, 4:8:9:5:1: This number of Worth being caſt up, amounteth to 27. And thus much for the Colonels Diviſion.</p>
                     <p>Now for the left Half-ranks, or Lieutenant-Colonels Diviſion, (as many times it is ſo ordred and appointed) his own Company being drawn up upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part on the left of the Regiment; and next to his right after each other is drawn up the third, ſeventh, fourth, and Majors Company; whoſe Figure of Dignity ſtanding Rank-wiſe, may be thus deſcribed, 2:6:10:7:3: and their number of Dignity in all amounteth to 28. Where you may perceive a rule that the Diſcretion of the Major walketh by, in the drawing up of the Regiment, to ballance with as neer proportion as he can the Number, Worth, and Dignity of his right Half-ranks, or right Flank, ſutable with that of the left. For it would be unreaſonable that all the beſt men ſhould be on the right, and that the left of the Regiment who are to oppoſe the Enemies right ſhould have the weakeſt or meaneſt men of Worth: therefore without all queſtion, that Body of men that ſhall be drawn up ſo as to make all parts of equal Worth, and Strength, as the right Flank with the left, the Front with the Reer, ſo that where-ever the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhall fall on to charge any one of theſe parts, being all made equal in Strength, and Worth, it muſt needs prevent all murmuring complaints, and carry beſt approbation to all knowing Commanders. And thus much briefly may be ſpoken in the commendation of the ordring of his Regiment thus far.</p>
                     <p>The Captains now ſtanding by their own Colours, on the head of the Pikes, and their Companies being drawn up all, and ſtanding in an even Front, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor next commands the Muskettiers to ſtand, the Pikes and Colours to troop forth ſome ten or twelve paces cleer of the Muskettiers, and then they likewiſe to ſtand, and after to cloſe their Files to the midſt to order.</p>
                     <p>Next he commands the Muskettiers in their Files to cloſe outward to order, commanding them afterward to move up, and flank the Pikes, after which he orders the Body into thirteen remarkable Diviſions, four Diviſions of Muskettiers upon each ſide of the Pikes, and the Pikes into five diviſions, having their Colours fly by two and two, and to be led by the Enſign-bearers that do belong to each of them, excepting the firſt and middle diviſions, for they have Leaders in chief, as the firſt and fifth Captain, and the third Captain, to bring up the Reer of the whole Body of Pikes. For more fuller illuſtration of the leading and bringing up of each diviſion in the Regiment upon their Long-march, obſerve theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The Regiment being upon their march, the firſt diviſion upon the right is led by the Colonel, his Captain-Lieutenant marching in the Reer of him ſeveral paces, and that particular diviſion is brought up by the Captains-Lieutenants Bringer-up.</p>

                     <p>Notwithſtanding I have thus laid down the manner of the Diviſions, with the placing of the Officers, there are alſo from all theſe diviſions both of the Pikes and Muskettiers, ſub-diviſions drawn off upon the Long-march betwixt every fifth or ſixth File, as they can equally divide them with even proportions to march. And for the leading of ſuch diviſions, there are Serjeants caſt in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong unto them which do lead and bring them up; ſo that upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt they make in their Long-regimental-march ſome thirty diviſions, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as I conceive, upon any Alt, or convenient place of drawing them all up e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven abreſt, the Serjeants as well as the ſuperiour-Officers may be helpful to bring up the File-leaders again as at the firſt into their proper places.

                     <p>Here you may perceive they follow a rule to Ballance their number of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as neer as they can, carrying their odd number on the left Half-rank, and not upon the right; for theſe reaſons, as, I conceive, following. Their Regiments being ſo full of men, they draw them up for the moſt part into three Squadrons,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108706:90"/>
or grand diviſions, giving unto the Lieutenant-Colonel the right Wing; the Major, the left; and the Colonel, the Main-battail. The Colonels grand Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion conſiſts of the four middle Companies, where you are to take notice, being drawn off ſome ten paces cleer from the reſt they ſtand after this manner by way of Figure, 4:7:9:1. The Lieutenant-Colonels Diviſion after this manner, 5:10:2. and the Majors after this kinde, 6:8:3. Wherein I do obſerve in each grand Diviſion this Rule, that by ſucceſſion and degrees they put the beſt Souldiers upon the right, and the ſecond according to courſe upon the left, and the reſt between them. As firſt, the Colonel being the chiefeſt man of honour, is placed upon the right of his Squadron; next to his left is the ſixth and fourth Captain, and the cloſing up of his grand Diviſion is placed the firſt or eldeſt Captain. The Lieutenant-Colonel being the ſecond man of honour, is likewiſe placed upon the right of his Squadron; and next to his left, the ſeventh Captain, his grand Diviſion being cloſed up by the ſecond Captain. In the next place, the Major, he being the third man of honour, is placed upon the right of his Squadron; and upon hisleft, the fifth Captain; and his grand Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is cloſed up upon the left by the third Captain. So that you may obſerve in the cloſing up of every Diviſion, that as every Field-Officer is upon the right of their Squadrons, ſo they take by degrees upon the outmoſt of their left to cloſe their Diviſions, the Captains according to their degrees by ſucceſſion. As firſt, and more cleerly, the Colonel takes the eldeſt Captain to him on his left, who will aptly fall in to lead his Body of Pikes and Colours; the Lieutenant-Colonel takes the ſecond Captain for to lead his Stand of Pikes and Colours; the third Captain being placed upon the left of the outmoſt part of the Majors Squadron, to lead likewiſe his Colours and Body of Pikes. And further, if you obſerve the number of worth and dignity, that the right Wing hath with the left, you will finde them to be equally ballanced, and to be ſeventeen alike in number. Now in reſpect there cannot be an equal Diviſion of the Colours by threes, there is very good reaſon that the odd ſhould be placed in the Colonels Squadron, who is Commander in chief, and to whom it properly belongs unto.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, I ſhall ſhew you how to draw them forth in a Regimental-way; the four middle Companies being advanced forward ten paces cleer form the three outmoſt Companies, may ſtand; then draw forth the Pikes of each Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, until they be ten foot cleer of their Muskettiers; then cloſe Pikes into the midſt to Order in their Files in each Diviſion, and they will be in three Bodies; after cloſe the Muskettiers into the midſt to Order, then ſub-divide them in as equal a way as you can; and let them move up upon the right and left, and flank each Body of Pikes. Then let the Major examine the Files in the Colonels Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, how many they exceed in number the other two, and he will finde twelve Files of Muskettiers, and ſix Files of Pikes, more then in the reſt. Now to make them equal alike in each Squadron, let him take off from each particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Colonels Squadron, one File of Pikes, and place two of thoſe four in the midſt of the Lieutenant-Colonels Squadron, and the remaining two in the midſt of his own Squadron; which being done, each body of Pikes will have in it 22 Files. After let him take off from each Company two Files of Muskettiers, which will be eight Files, &amp; let him place two Files in the midſt of each Flank of Muskettiers, both in the Diviſions of the Lieutenant-Colonels and his own; and then there will be in each particular Diviſion of Muskettiers 21 Files. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe a very good way to draw up a Regiment of ſo great a number of men, I was unwilling to paſs it by, but to preſent it unto the view of all loving Souldiers, which will more fuller appear in the Figure following (Folio 167) in which Figure I ſhall ſhew the ſeveral places of the Captains, and their Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, where they are to lead, and where to bring up.</p>

In the next place, draw forth all the Pikes, and ingroſs them into two Bodies; then divide the Muskettiers into
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108706:91"/>
four parts, and move them up, and Flank thoſe Stands of Pikes, and they will be in two grand Diviſions; then, place the Officers after this manner; beginning firſt with the Colonels diviſion, make two Diviſions of Muskettiers in his Van, let the firſt be led by the Captain Lieutenant, and be brought up by his Bringer-up; let the next Diviſion of Muskettiers be led by the fourth Captains Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and brought up by the third Captains Lieutenant; let the Pikes be divided into three Diviſions, the Colours flying two and two upon the head of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let the firſt Diviſion be led by the eldeſt Captain, and brought up by the ninth Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Lieutenant; let the next Diviſion be led by the ſixth Captain, and brought up by his own Lieutenant; let the laſt Diviſion be led by the fourth Captain, and the whole Body of Pikes be brought up by the ninth Captain.

                     <p>Having placed the Officers in the firſt grand Diviſion, he may proceed unto the next; let the firſt Diviſion of Muskettiers be led by the Majors-Lieutenant, and brought up by the fifth Captains Lieutenant. Let the Pikes be divided into three parts, the Colours likewiſe flying, two and two upon the head of them; then let the firſt Diviſion be led by the fifth Captain, and brought up by the eighth Captains Lieutenant; next let the ſecond Diviſion be led by the eighth Captain, and brought up by the ſeventh Captains Lieutenant.

                     <p>Having thus far proceeded, he may command the four outmoſt Companies upon each Flank, to advance forward ſome ten paces cleer from the four middle Companies; then let them ſtand, and after let him draw forward the Pikes cleer from the Muskettiers, and cloſe their Files outward to Order; then let the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108706:92"/>
Muskettiers be divided into four parts, their Files being cloſed to Order, let them move forward, and flank thoſe two Bodies of Pikes. After in the ſame manner move forward the Pikes in the four middle Companies, until they be cleer of the Muskettiers, and cloſe their Files into the midſt to Order, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their Muskettiers into two parts, and let them move forward, and flank the Body of Pikes; and then they will ſtand in their Squadrons or grand Diviſions, their dignities ſtanding after this manner in the Colonels diviſion, thus, 4:9:12:1. In the Lieutenant-Colonels diviſion, thus, 5:8:11:2. and in the the Majors, thus, 6:7:10:3. So that you may perceive this to be a very good way amongſt the reſt, each particular Squadron bearing the number of 26, and having unto every one of them their Dignities and worths equally divided, and ſtated alike. In the next place, the Major ought to inquire of the number of men they carry in each diviſion of both Arms; where as firſt, he ſhall finde in the Colonels Squadron, to have in it 26 Files of Pikes, and 52 Files of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; and examining all the reſt, they will fall out to the ſame proportion of number. So that in each Diviſion there contains, whether they be Pikes, or Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers, to have in every particular thereof 78 Files. In the next place, he ſhall do well to appoint forth unto them their ſeveral places to lead and bring up; and firſt, of the Colonels grand Diviſion, he being on the head thereof, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Lieutenant leading the firſt diviſion of Muskettiers in his Squadron, being brought up by his Bringer-up; the firſt two Colours, and his half Body of Pikes to be led by the eldeſt Captain, and brought up by the ninth Captains Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the next two Colours, and half Body of Pikes to be led by the ninth Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and brought up by the eldeſt Captains Lieutenant; the laſt diviſion of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers in his Squadron, to be led by the ſixth Captain, and brought up by his own Lieutenant. The firſt diviſion of Muskettiers in the Lieutenant-colonels Squadron, is led by his own Lieutenant, and brought up by the eighth Captains Lieutenant; his firſt two Colours, and half Body of Pikes is led by the ſeventh Captain; and the next two Colours, and half Body of Pikes, is led by the eigthth Captain, and brought up by the ſecond Captains Lieutenant; his laſt diviſion of Muskettiers is led by the fifth Captain, and brought up by his own Lieutenant; himſelf ſtanding as the Colonel doth upon the head of his Squadron. The firſt diviſion of Muskettiers in the Majors Squadron (himſelf being upon the head) is led by his own Lieutenant, and brought up by the ſeventh Captains Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; his firſt two Colours, and half Body of Pikes is led by the third Captain; and the next two Colours, and half Body of Pikes, is led by the ſeventh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and brought up by the third Captains Lieutenant; his laſt diviſion of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers is led by the fourth Captain, and brought up by his Lieutenant; as in the next place, in the Figure ſet forth in Folio 170, more fully appeareth.</p>
                     <p>They ſtanding according to the former directions in three Bodies of Pikes flanked with the Muskettiers, before they come to the Figure ſet forth, you muſt command in each grand diviſion the ſix inmoſt Files of Muskettiers next the Pikes to face about, and to march ſix paces cleer of the Reer, and then cloſe inward to Order. Afterward open every four Files outward to open Order, of thoſe 12 Files, and let the middle-diviſion there face about, and move down ſix foot cleer of the Reer; and after face to their Leader. Then there will remain 20 Files of Muskettiers upon the Flanks of each Body of Pikes; after move for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the eight middle Files of particular diviſion of Muskettiers, ſome ten foot before the Front. Then command the left-half-ranks, or the four Files of Muskettiers upon the left of thoſe diviſions drawn forth, to face about, and to move down ten foot cleer of the Reer, and after face to the Front. Then let the 12 remaining Files of Muskettiers cloſe to the Pikes to open Order; and let every four Files of thoſe remaining 12 upon the Flanks, open outward ſix foot of ground betwixt each four Files, and move the Front and Reer-diviſions of Muskettiers juſt againſt the midſt of thoſe three diviſions of Muskettiers that are the Flankers to the Pikes, and they will ſtand in the Figure as it is placed in Folio 170.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The States Army by order of his Highneſs, is divided upon a March into three Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades or Tertia's; and a Serjeant-Major of a Tertia, being one of the great Captains of the Field, receives his Order immediate from the Lord-General, or the Lord Martial, but moſt commonly of the Serjeant-Major-General of the Army, how he ſhall form and order his Brigade or Tertia; and how many Regiments of Horſe and Foot are to march under it, and with what Ordnance and Baggage. He aſſigns and ſhews him the place where they are to draw out into Battalia, and receives Orders from the Serjeant-Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, whether they are to march in the Van-guard, the Battail, or the Reer: So that in marching in every one of theſe, he ſhall attend upon his Brigade and ſeveral Diviſions; and in the abſence of the Serjeant-Major-General, ſee that the order of marching and embattailing be duly kept and obſerved. And every one of theſe three Serjeants-Majors of Brigades, are to be at the command of the Colonel, General, or be that leads or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that Brigade or Tertia; and is to be ſent to the Lord-General, Lord-Martial, or Serjeant-Major-General upon any occaſion belonging to the ſervice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe three Majors of the Tertia's are to be lodged as neer the Serjeant-Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as conveniently may be; and thoſe three which attend upon the Van-guard, the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail or Reer, which the Serjeant-Major ſhall make choice of ground for the placing of Guards, and aſſign them to the Serjeant-Majors of every Regiment. They are to go the Round, and to viſit the Guard commonly every night, and at ſuch an hour as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant-Major ſhall appoint them either by day or night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If any of theſe three Serjeant-Majors of the Field ſhall finde any want of Powder, Ammunition or Victuals, either in the Van-guard, Battail or Reer, as well upon the march, as when the Troops are quartered, or during fight, he is preſently to advertiſe the Serjeant-Major-General of the Field with the ſaid wants. And then by his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhall go with an Officer of every Regiment of that Tertia, to the General, or Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Ordnance, or to the Commiſſary General of the Ammunition, or Victuals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Serjeant-Major of a Tertia, to conclude, having received his Orders from the Lord-General, the Martial, or Serjeant-Major-general, gives them to the Serjeant-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors of every particular Regiment. But becauſe the Word and Orders are to be ſent to Quarters far diſtant one from another, the Serjeant-Major of every Regiment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:108706:95"/>
come conveniently to the Serjeant-Major-General. Therefore the Majors of every Brigade are to attend every morning and evening upon the Serjeant-Major-General, to receive their Orders, and to carry the Word to the ſeveral Quarters, whither the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant-Majors of Regiments comes to him, and from him receives the Word and Orders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The drawing up of Brigades in the next place comes to be handled after the way of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> therefore, firſt take notice, that Brigades are not tyed to a ſet number of Companies or Regiments, but are ordered according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtrengths of an Army. As ſometimes they conſiſt of 12 Companies, ſome of two Regiments, others of three, or four, having in them not alike number of Companies or men, which ought accordingly unto the ſeveral Diviſions of a Brigade to be ballanced alike, both in number of men, dignity, and worth, as is in particular Regiments fully ſet forth. And in reſpect that ſeveral Diviſions make a Brigade, and that according to the diſpoſition of an Army, all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers are divided into three parts, called Brigades or Tertia's, each of them having a ſeveral name; to wit, the Van-guard, Battail and Reer-guard. Now that Tertia which is to march firſt, is called the Van-guard; that which marcheth next in the middle, the Battail; and that which comes up laſt, the Reer. Every one of theſe upon march, as was formerly expreſſed in the Swediſh Brigade, take their turns interchangeably; for the ſecond day of the March, the Battail becomes the Van-guard; and the Reer, the ſecond day the Battail; and the third day, the Tertia, that had firſt the Reer, is become the Van-guard. So likewiſe, there ought to be in every particular Brigade or Tertia, a Van-guard, Battail and Reer-guard, to each of them; which with more conveniencie may be orderly brought to fight by him that ſhall be Commander in chief, for the relieving each other, according as occaſion ſhall require.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, for a Brigade, I ſhall point forth four Regiments, having in them eight Companies a piece, after the manner of a Regiment of eight former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down, which amounts to 3888 men, which number may ſerve for a third part of an Army of foot, and make up a very compleat and ſufficient Brigade. And I ſhall order in this Brigade to have in it four Diviſions; that is to ſay, a Van-guard, Battail and Reer-guard, repreſented in the three firſt Regiments; but the fourth ſhall be a reſerve, ſtanding in the Reer of the Main-battail or Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, whereby upon all occaſions of the other retreating, or being driven back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that Regiment may move up to relieve each part thereof that ſhall be diſtreſſed. But upon the Long-march of this Brigade, the two middle Regiments according to their order of dignity, are to make the Battail, which in the Figure were made the Van-guard, and Reer-guard; and that which formerly was the Van-guard, is become the Battail; and the Reer-guard, the Reſerve; but where they have ground ſufficient, it will be better to march in that form of Battalia, ſet down according to the Figure, Folio 176.</p>
                     <p>This Brigade conſiſting of four Regiments, muſt be drawn up according to the dignity of their Captains; but with this alteration of Arms, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Regiments conſiſting of two Diviſions, this hath but one, after this manner:</p>

                     <p>THe drawing up or an Army moſt properly belongs to the Serjeant-Major-General, whoſe place and charge is of an high degree, his commands being
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:108706:98"/>
full of action, and therefore ought to be a wiſe, grave, and able perſon, and an experienced Souldier, in reſpect he hath the ordering and diſpoſing of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Battalions, according to that form which the General ſhall command him. And upon all occaſions he muſt be active, and ſtirring up and down to ſpie out all advantages which might offend an Enemy; and wiſely to foreſee all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages that may bring the Troops into any diſorder or confuſion. He hath abſolute command over the three Serjeant-Majors of the <hi>Brigades,</hi> otherwiſe called the three <hi>Grand Corporals</hi> of the Field, who are to be his aſſiſtants, and his mouth, as he is the mouth of the Lord General, or Martial of the Field; and therefore muſt have a vigilant eye over all things, ſeeing that the Generals com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand delivered to him be ſtrictly kept and obſerved; and withall acquainting and informing the three Serjeant-Majors of the <hi>Brigades</hi> of the Generals pleaſure, that they may forthwith put the ſame into execution.</p>
                     <p>Now the Method (that I ſhall obſerve) ſhall be according to the form of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Brigade;</hi> wherefore in the firſt place, the Serjeant-Major ſhall do well to appoint out unto the eldeſt Serjeant-Major of the <hi>Brigades,</hi> how to draw up that <hi>Brigade</hi> which ſhall be the Battail, wherein the Lord Generals Regiment, and the Colonels is to be upon the right and left of that <hi>Brigade,</hi> and betwixt them the eldeſt Colonel, and ninth Colonel, according to this rule of Dignity in the Figure ſet forth, 4:9:12:1. In the next place, let the next Serjeant-Major of the <hi>Brigades</hi> in ſeniority draw up that which ſhall be the Van-guard, and place the ſecond Colonels Regiment upon the right, and the fifth upon the left, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them the eleventh and eighth Colonels, after this manner of this Figure, 5:8:11:2. Let the laſt Serjeant-Major draw up that <hi>Brigade</hi> which ſhall be in the Reer, and let him draw them up after this manner; the third Colonels Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment upon the right; and upon the left the ſixth Colonels; and between them the tenth and ſeventh Colonels Regiment after this manner, 6:7:10:3: This charge being given by the Serjeant-Major-General unto the three Serjeant-Majors of the three <hi>Tertias</hi> or <hi>Brigades,</hi> how each particular Regiment ſhall be drawn up, being every one ſingle, and compared alike each to other, being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated according to the rule of Dignity, avoiding thereby confuſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. In the next place, for the better expedition in drawing up the Army, every Serjeant-Major of each <hi>Brigade</hi> draws the former Regiments aſſigned unto them, unto ſuch place as ſhall be appointed forth unto them by the Serjeant-Major-General, being helped and aſſiſted by the Field-Officers of the ſame Regiments, the Serjeant-Major-General being an aſſiſtant unto them all, ſeeing thereby all the Commands of the General rightly obſerved and fulfilled.</p>

                     <p>After this, the General of the Ordnance, his duty and care muſt be in the day of Battail, to ſee that the Ordnance be well placed; for at ſuch time his wiſdom is moſt diſcern'd, keeping (with the aſſiſtance of his Lieutenant) the Train of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery together in good order. He muſt have a vigilant eye upon all accidents that may fall but, and make choiſe of ſuch ground for their planting, as the General of the Army and he ſhall think moſt fit and convenient. He muſt be careful that all things be in a readineſs, putting the Maſter, Gunners, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Ordnance, and Commanders in minde of their duty, that they do their beſt endeavours, and acquit themſelves like men. It is likewiſe partly his charge to ſee that the whole Army be well provided with Ammunition, becauſe the Ammunition marcheth under his Train. He muſt alſo be neer the General of the Army upon all occaſions, to receive his Directions and Commands, and to know from him after what manner he will make his Battail, that he may plant his Ordnance accordingly, finding out Hills and Heights to play over his own men. And when the Enemy ſhall preſent himſelf, and come up to charge, he muſt draw, and plant his Ordnance as neer their Horſe as poſſible may be, to hinder them from breaking in upon the Diviſions of Foot, taking along with him Saylours, and Pioneers, to help to draw up the Ordnance, and ſufficient Guards to defend them.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the planting of the Ordnance, when the Battalia is drawn up, they may be diſpoſed of ſeveral ways; as ſometimes they are placed upon the head of the Battalia; others again between them, by two and two; and others threes, upon the Flanks and Wings of the Muskettiers. Some are of opinion, that they ought to be planted upon the Flank, and in the Reer of the Battalia, by leaving a free place for Arms which may give no offence to their own men. But as concerning this laſt way, it might be anſwered, it can no way be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; for if an Enemy ſhould perceive that the Frout is left bare without Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it will give them cauſe to come up with more courage to fall on upon the Charge. Therefore, the beſt way amongſt the ancient experienc'd Souldiers, is, that the Artillery be divided, ſome here, ſome there, both before the Front, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Battalions, and upon the Flanks, and to be placed ſome 50 or an 100 paces one from another; and then there will be no danger when the Enemy ſhall come up to ſhock to encounter you, or to offend our own men: Eſpecially, when they are faſtned to them by drawing Ropes and Iron Rings, that upon an inſtant they may be removed, and turn'd for the advantage of our own Troops, giving fire as faſt as they can charge and diſcharge againſt the Enemies Troops, it being a matter of great moment for the obtaining of a Victory, and gaining the day from the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>But that many times the Ordnance cannot be planted in ſuch convenient places as could be wiſhed for, in reſpect an Army may be driven into ſuch places, as the Ordnance muſt be planted according to the beſt ground it will afford, by reaſon of Woods, Hills, or Mariſh-grounds; and ſuch like diſadvantageous places, may be oftentimes met withal; for which no certain Rule may be given, but that the General by his wiſdom and diſcretion may make choice of the beſt advantages, which might annoy an Enemy moſt, and give the leaſt offence to his own men, either by dazling them by the Sun, or by raiſing of the duſt, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the winde which drives the Smoak both of the Ordnance and Small-ſhot full upon them. To conclude, it is conceived the beſt way for every Captain of the Ordnance, and Maſter-Gunner, to uſe ſome light Field-peeces and ſmall Drakes, which upon any occaſion may be removed from one place to another, being with eaſe planted upon ſuch places of advantage, as may moſt annoy the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, 3000 Horſe may be a good proportion for 10000 or 12000
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:108706:103"/>
foot, which ought to be equally divided in their Troops, and placed upon the Flanks of the foot in ſuch good order, as the Troops may come with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie to fight, for the relieving of each other. But in caſe you ſhall perceive the Enemies Horſe, as ſometimes through neceſſity of ground, or by other politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ends, may be interlaced and placed between the Intervals and Diviſions of their foot; it will be needful then that we ſhould obſerve the ſame form, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have Horſe to come forth, and encounter with their Horſe, leſt they ſhould break in upon our Diviſions of Foot; which by this means and good order, may be timely prevented. Next follows the Figure of the Army, as before deſcribed, and ordered to be drawn up, Folio 176.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> The ſeveral duties belonging to the Foot in a Regiment, as followeth by degrees from a private Souldier unto a Colonel of the ſame: and firſt, of a Private Souldier.</head>
                     <p>A Private Souldier ought to be very active, not ſlothful and idle, informing himſelf of his duty, learning from his Corporal, or other Officers, the true uſe and well handling of his Arms, always keeping them neat, clean, and well fixed. Upon the beat of the Drum, he is to repair to his Colours, Squadron; or Company; upon the march, he muſt obſerve his Leader, and his right and left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand-men, that he may march ſtreight in file, and even in rank; in time of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe he muſt be ſilent in the Body, well minding the words of Command and Directions, which are given forth by the Leader. He ought likewiſe to be well vers'd in all the ordinary words of Command; and to mind the place wherein he ſtands, that he may the more readier move, and not be to ſeek at ſuch time when he ſhall be commanded, whether it be to face, double, counter-march, or wheel. He muſt inform himſelf of all the ſeveral beats of the Drum; as firſt, or a Call; ſecond, a Troop; third, a March; fourth, a Preparative; fifth, a Battle or Charge; ſixth, a Retreat, and alſo of the Revalley and the Tattoo.</p>
                     <p>By the firſt, he is ſummoned to hear preſent Proclamation, or elſe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repair to his Colours; upon the beat of the ſecond, he is to advance his Arms, and to cloſe in Rank and File, to the diſtance of Order, and to Troop along un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch places and ſervices, as he ſhall be commanded unto; upon the hearing of the third, he is preſently to ſhoulder his Arms, and to take his diſtance of ſix foot in Rank, and three foot in File; upon the fourth, he is to cloſe both in Rank and File, unto the fighting diſtance, which is called Order, and to prepare himſelf for skirmiſh; upon the beat of the next, he is undauntedly to move forward, boldly ſtepping in good Order, into the place of his fellow-Souldier that ſhall happen to fall down dead before him; upon the beat of the laſt, he muſt orderly fall back, either for relief or advantage of ground, or other political ends whereby he may draw the Enemy into a ſnare. The firſt of the remaining two, gives warning in the morning for ſome of the Sentinels to fall off, or to be taken in; the latter is uſed in the night to give notice unto the Souldiers, or others, for their repairing to their ſeveral Guards, Watches, and Lodgings. To conclude, a private Souldier ought to avoid all Quarrelling, Mutinies, Swearing, Curſing or Lying, and to be content with his wages; and likewiſe to be a good Husband in the well managing of his means, keeping himſelf neat and handſome in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; avoiding drunkenneſs, and all manner of gaming; truely to ſerve and fear God, and to be obedient unto all the commands of his ſuperiours, cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going on upon all Duties, and to be loving, kind, and courteous unto all his fellow-Souldiers.</p>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>The duty of a Sentinel.</head>
                        <p>A Sentinel muſt be very vigilant, carefully caſting his eyes about him, and harkning whether he hear the noiſe or approach of any drawing neer him; which if he perceive, he is preſently to command them to ſtand, preſenting his Musket or Pike to their breſt, after calling his Corporal for to take the Word, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108706:103"/>
he ſhould be commanded to come in ſilently. He is not to come off until he be relieved by the Corporal or Lanſpaſſadoe.</p>
                        <p>His proper Poſture, being a Muskettier, is to have his Musket reſted, and loaded with Powder and Bullet, his Match cockt, and his Pan guarded; being a Pike-man, if he ſtand Sentinel in the night, he muſt have his Pike cheek'd; if in the day, his Pike ordered: Or it may be a very proper Poſture for a Pike-man to ſtand Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel with his Pike in his left-hand, holding it a little below the cheeks thereof, and with his Sword drawn, being held in his right-hand, which I leave to judge, or to be made uſe of according to diſcretion, and as occaſion ſhall require.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>Of a Gentleman of a Company.</head>
                        <p>A Gentleman of a Company ought to have ſuch worth in him as may make him capable to be a File-leader, or Captain of his File; and he more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly above the reſt ought to be well skill'd in all the Poſtures of ſuch Arms he wears; and at convenient times inſtructing and teaching his File in the neat and graceful handling of their Arms. He ought to be of an undaunted courage and gallant reſolution, for the better Example and imitation of the reſt; whoſe worth and valour many times indears them ſo much into the favour of their Commanders, that they raiſe them up to greater places of preferment. In the Low-Countries a Gentleman of a Company hath his full pay, having nothing kept back for after-reckonings, as common private Souldiers have. At his firſt entrance he ſometimes ſtands Sentinel, to inform himſelf of the Duties thereof; but moſt commonly he is placed to be a Sentinel <hi>perdu</hi> in time of imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either in the Field, or upon approaches. He is to lie <hi>perdu</hi> with his Sword and Piſtol, not removing from his place till he be relieved; nor is he to retreat for one man, but in caſe of more, then he is to fall back to the ſecond; and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering an Enemy, he is to come off betimes, and ſilently to give the Alarum, whereby the <hi>Corps du Guard</hi> or Company may be provided for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. A Gentleman of a Company doth many times go the Round with the Captain of the Watch, or his Fellow-Gentlemen, who are likewiſe Rounders, either in the Field, or in Garriſon; and do give the Corporals of the Guards the Word, charging the Sentinels to look well about them. To conclude, he ought truely to love, reſpect, and obey his Captain, and to ſtick cloſe unto him, vindicating him upon juſt occaſions, when he ſhall be wronged and injured by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mutinies of the common Souldiers, or others.</p>

                        <head>Of a Barber-Chyrurgion.</head>
                        <p>IN every Company there ought to be a Barber-Chyrurgion for the trimming of the Souldiers, who ought likewiſe to have ſome skill in Chyrurgery; that when the Souldiers are upon the Watches and Guards, where imminent danger may be, he may be then at hand, to be ready in the abſence of the Chyrurgion of the Regiment to bind up, and dreſs the hurt and wounded men. He is free from duties belonging to the Company; and in ſome places, is allowed to be an Officer in the Liſt of their Armies, which I conceive it ought ſo to be, in reſpect they allow but of one Chyrurgion to a Regiment; and if it ſhould happen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be wounded, as oftentimes in field-fights there are, one man is not able ſcarce in three days to bind up the wounds, and dreſs the ſores of them that are maimed. And therefore it concerns every Captain to be provided, and to have in the abſence of the Chyrurgion, a Barber-Chyrurgion attending on his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>

                        <p>HIs carriage ought to be very juſt and honeſt; his chiefeſt duty is to keep the Muſter-Roll, and to have it ready upon all occaſions for the entring of his men upon the Muſter-Roll, and Pay-bill. He is many times intruſted to receive the Service-mony of the Company, and pays ſuch monies unto the Souldiers as ſhall be ordered him from his Captain to pay. He muſt inquire out in their
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:108706:104"/>

                        <p>THere ought to be in every Regiment a Drum-Major, being skilful in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, inſtructing the others in the true beating of a March, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points of VVar. A Drum-Major muſt likewiſe be well skill'd in ſeveral Languages and Tongues, and to be wiſe and courteous when he ſhall be imploy'd or ſent to an Enemy: He is in a diſcreet manner upon the marching of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to order part of the Drums where they ſhall beat, ſeeing them truely and duly relieved by the others for the better performance of their ſervice. For up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the march, if all the Captains Drums ſhould beat together, it would quickly tire them out; therefore for their eaſe, it is his place and duty to order them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to diſcretion to take their turns to beat, and to be relieved by each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He is, moreover, to take into his charge ſuch Drums as ſhall be brought in from the Enemies by their Drummers, when they come to ranſom their priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and upon their return to deliver them again unto them. He ought to be lodged neer the Serjeant-Major, in reſpect he is to give inſtructions to the reſt of the Drummers, and may upon fail of their Duties give them correction.</p>

                        <p>EVery Captain ought to have two good Drummers, that knows-how to beat all the ſeveral points of War before mentioned. It is likewiſe expedient that he ſhould be a good Linguiſt, in reſpect ſometimes he may be ſent unto an Enemy for the ranſoming of Priſoners: His duty is, coming to the Camp or Garriſon of an Enemy, having his Generals Paſs in his Hat, to beat a Call, till he is fetcht in; and becauſe he ſhall not diſcover the weakneſs of Guards, Works or Trenches, he is led blind-fold, and ſo carried to the Commander, and place where his Priſoners are: VVith whom (after he hath ranſomed them) he is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his own Quarters, giving an account of ſuch things he hath ſeen or heard, which may prove advantageous to his own party, or of any other thing he had opportunity by their neglect to take notice of.</p>

                        <p>HIs Duty is to ſee that the Souldiers keep their Arms neat and clean, and that they be well fixed; and if any thing be amiſs or broken, he is to have them carried to the Armourers to be repaired. And if any Souldier ſhall be ſick, dead, or have leave to return to his own Country, he is to bring his Arms to his own Lodging, there preſerving and keeping them clean, until he ſhall have occaſion to deliver them to ſome other newly entertained. He is likewiſe to mark and figure the Arms of the Company, and to preſerve and keep a Liſt what number of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure each Souldier ſhould bear upon his Arms.

                        <p>THe Corporals of a Company are not tyed to a ſet number, but to be ordered according to the ſeveral ſtrengths and diviſions of the ſame, for each to take
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108706:104"/>
his charge and care of every Squadron thereof. And unto each of them there is a Lanſpaſſadoe for an aſſiſtant: for their Rule of Dignity, I conceive, it makes not much more matter then to make them the right-hand File-leader in every particular diviſion; but if any will be ſo curious to order them according to that, let them apply themſelves unto the former Rules for directions to the ſame. The Corporals duty in his Squadron is to teach and inſtruct them in the uſe of the Pike and Musket, and to have a Roll and Liſt of his men in his Diviſion or Squadron. And when a Souldiers name is croſſed out, he is to give notice unto his Serjeant; and when a new one ſhall ſupply his place, his care muſt be to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and enable him in the Poſtures of ſuch Arms as he ſhall bear. Being with his Squadron upon his Guard, he is to provide them with Wood, Coal, Candle and light. Having an Out-guard, his care muſt be to ſtrengthen it, his little <hi>Corps du Guard</hi> and Sentinels muſt be forth according to the avenews or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on of the Enemy, whereby he prevents their cutting off or ſurpriſal; the negligence whereof proves both dangerous to themſelves, and the whole Army. Wherefore it behoves him to be very careful and vigilant to viſit them, after giving them an eſpecial charge to be both faithful and careful in the great truſt repoſed in them. He muſt likewiſe preſerve and keep the Word conſtant in his memory; when the Captain of the Watch goes the firſt Round, he ſhall with his Sword drawn againſt his breſt give it him, and receive ſuch Orders from him as he ſhall command him; but afterwards when the Round ſhall come again, he ſhall cauſe the Rounders or Gentlemen (with his Sword drawn) to give the Word to him before they paſs. He ought never to go alone, being called forth by the Sentinel, but to have a Guard of three or four Muskettiers along with him, ſelected out of his <hi>Corps du Guard.</hi> He muſt adviſe his Sentinels how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themſelves upon the diſcovery of an Enemy, either to give an Alarum, or elſe to give notice without making a noiſe. And if upon his Guard he ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerve, or be advertiſed by his Sentinels of the approach of the Enemy, then he is to have his men in readineſs with Bullets in their Muskets, and their Matches lighted; himſelf ſecretly coming in, giving intelligence unto his Captain, or other Superiour Officer, whereby they may all be in a readineſs before the Alarum be given. He is likewiſe to diſtribute Victual, Powder, Bullet and Match, unto his Squadron, and to take notice of the beſt experienced men, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to imploy them upon action upon the Watches. He muſt cauſe reſpect to be given to the <hi>Corps du Guard;</hi> and ſilence to be kept, whether it be about the Walls or Gates, that ſo the noiſe may not hinder the hearing of the advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Sentinels. He is likewiſe to have an eye to their lives and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to take care of the Baggage and Money of ſuch as are hurt or ſick, and to be in his own carriage ſober, wiſe and diſcreet, for the avoiding ill example un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others.</p>

                        <p>HE ought to take into his cuſtody all perſons committed unto his charge by the chief Officers of the Regiment; and if they be called to juſtice, he is to bring them to the Martial-General, who are to be carried from thence to the Council of War. It is alſo his care to ſee that all Women, Boyes, Servants, Bread, and Aquavita-ſellers, belonging to the Regiment, do march in the Reer, and not before, or upon the Flanks. He is likewiſe to ſet ſuch prizes upon Beer and Victuals, as the Lord-Martial, or Serjeant-Major-General ſhall appoint; which Order he ſhall receive from the Provoſt-Martial of the Army, and to ſee it duly executed within the Circuit of the Regiment: And that the Sutlers do not ſell their Beer and Victuals above the ſet rate, leſt they grate upon the Souldiers. After the Captain of the Watch hath gone the firſt Round, he is to ſee that the Sutlers keep no tipling or diſorder in the night, but make them put out their Candle-light and Fires.

                        <p>IF the Regiment be marching with the Army, (and not alone) he is then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evening to attend upon the Quarter-Maſter-General, to receive his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and to take the place, ground, and houſes, appointed by him, for the Quarter and Lodging of the Regiment; who preſently is to acquaint and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe his Colonel of the ſame, and after to follow his charge. Firſt, he appointeth or prepareth the Colonels Lodging, and other Officers of the Field, in the Center or midſt of all the Quarters; and neer them himſelf, and all the other Officers of the Staff. After, according to the ſeniority of the Captains, and their march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to diſtribute forth their Quarters as may be deſigned. Having thus far acted through the help of the Conſtables and Head-boroughs of thoſe places where the Regiment is to Quarter; and having drawn forth their Billets in a good and orderly way, he is before the Regiments entring the Quarters, to deliver the ſame to the Colonel, or other Field-Officers of that Regiment; and they to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it to the reſt of the Captains, to direct them to their Lodgings, with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Souldiers of their Company. And during the time that he is about the viſiting the diſtribution of the Lodgings, all the Troops are to keep watch round about the place, and to ſend out to diſcover: he muſt alſo be informed of the Lodgings of the whole Army, to know whom to give, or whom to receive Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in caſe of neceſſity.</p>
                        <p>If the Quarter be in the open field, the Quarter-Maſter-General ſhall appoint to each Quarter-Maſter the place and ground which he ſhall take, which he is to diſtribute to the Serjeants of every Company of the Regiment, who are to aſſiſt him in taking the depth, length and breadth of their Quarters, with the diſtances of the Alarum-place between the head of the Quarters and the Trench, and the true diſtance of the Streets betwixt the in-getting of each Captains particular Company.</p>
                        <p>When an Army or Regiment ſhall ſit down before a Town, or forraging place, to beſiege it, they are imployed ſometimes to be Forragers to fetch in proviſion for the Army, or particular Regiments. Which when they ſhall be required, they ought to have ſufficient Convoys and Guards, both of Infantry and Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſecure them; who are to be commanded by able Officers; and the Provoſt-Martial, or one of his Aſſiſtants is to go along with them, to puniſh ſuch as are exorbitant, or do ſtraggle. It will be expedient to the Regiment, that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Maſter upon the Service may be imployed twice in a week, to bring in a freſh Victual to the Souldiers; but not to go twice to one place, leſt they be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Enemy, and be way-laid by their Forces, who may ſometimes prove ſtronger then themſelves, to prevent, or to cut them off by the way, laying of them ſecretly in ſome Ambuſhments: Which being truely conſidered of, care may be taken accordingly of Supplies in other remote places, free from the danger of the Enemy. To conclude, a Quarter-Maſter ought to carry himſelf honeſtly and carefully in his place, and to be well skill'd in the Art of Mathematicks, that he may the better give Directions for fortifying and meaſuring of ground, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of his whole Regiment, and in hutting of the particular Souldiers.</p>

                        <p>HE that is a Serjeant to a Company, ought to be well skill'd in the Poſtures and all Military Motions, whereby in the firſt place he may endeavour to correct the errours of ſuch who handle not the Arms in a handſome, or a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable way. And ſecondly, that he may be helpful to his Captain, or other Superiour Officer. In time of his Exerciſe, his duty is to draw forth the Files according to ſuch depths as ſhall be appointed unto him by his Captain, or other Superiour Officer, and to order them in the drawing up, and joyning together the Souldiers unto ſuch places of honour as they ſhall direct him unto. In a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Company he leadeth oftentimes a Diviſion, but ought not always there to march, in reſpect he is concerned to ſee that the Souldiers march even in their Ranks at their diſtance of Order in File, and open Order in Rank. To which
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108706:105"/>
purpoſe, he ought many times to be upon the Flanks, and perceiving any Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier out of order, he may caſt in his Halbert between their Ranks, to cauſe him to march even abreſt with his right and left-hand-men. He is likewiſe either in Field or Garriſon to lead his Squadron to their Guard, and to carry to priſon ſuch Offendours as his Captain or other Superiour Officer ſhall commit to the Provoſt-Martial. He is to ſee that the Muskettiers in time of skirmiſhing preſent all even abreſt, with their Matches all cockt, giving fire all together in good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and to direct them how to fall off, and rally again in the Reer of their own Diviſions. His duty likewiſe is to fetch Ammunition, Powder, Match, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Materials for the Company. He is, moreover, every particular evening to attend at the place of Parade, or at the Majors Lodging, to fetch the Word, and carry it to his Captain, Lieutenant, Enſign, and Corporals; and likewiſe as ſoon as he is come unto his Guard, he muſt direct the Corporals where to ſet out the Perdues and Sentinels, and how to order his Watch. He muſt likewiſe make Rounds; and if he finde a Sentinel aſleep in the Field, he is to commit him to the hand of Juſtice. And thus much concerning the duty of a Serjeant.</p>

His Captain and Lieutenant being preſent, and upon a Stand, his Colours ought to reſt upon his ſide, being held by his right or left-hand, and unfurled; upon the March, his Colours ought to be ſhouldered, taking up the corner-end of them in his right-hand, and to let them be half flying; the Pikes and Muskets all conforming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Poſture. Marching through a City, for the more grace, his Colours may be wholly flying, being advanced and held up by his right-hand, or reſting upon his right ſide. He ought to be a proper man, grave, valiant and diſcreet, and to be well skill'd in the Poſtures of the Pike; in reſpect he leads them, and they expect from him to be taught the Poſtures thereof. He ought to be well skill'd in all the lofty Figures of the diſplaying of the Colours above the head, and to make uſe of them according to diſcretion and command; which is not onely a healthfull exerciſe to his body, but alſo moſt becoming to him, or any other Gentleman or Commander whatſoever, that ſhall ſometimes make uſe of the ſame; although condemned through ſloth and ignorance by others, who will not take the pains to learn it. An Enſign upon a Troop, lodging he Colours, or in time of skirmiſhing, may fold them up, and retreat into the ſecond Rank for the ſecuring of his Colours, which he ought to ſtick by, and not to ſtir from them at ſuch a time, although he hazardeth his laſt drop of blood, or makes them his winding-ſheet. When the General ſhall paſs by, or any ſuch man of worth, he ought a little to vail his Colours, inclining the head, or narrow end thereof, a little downward; but not to bow his knee, or uncover his head. He may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for his eaſe or recreation upon the March, requeſt ſome Gentleman of knowing truſt of the Pikes to carry his Colours for him, until ſuch time as he ſhall come again for to take them. In the abſence of his Lieutenant, when his Captain ſhall exerciſe the Company, he may ſtick his Colours in the ground, or deliver them to ſome Gentleman of the Pikes, and fall down himſelf in the Reer with a Half-pike or Cane, there to be an aſſiſtant to his Captain in ſupplying the Lieutenants place, except his Captain ſhould command him to the contrary. He ought to have a Guard along with him, as well to the lodging of his Colours, as to any other place.

He is likewiſe at ſuch times frequently to exerciſe the Company in all their Military Motions, Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhings, and Falſe-firings in the pan. He is to hold the Serjeants and Corporals ſtrictly to their duty, cauſing them to provide all things neceſſary for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and to be aſſiſtants unto him where he ſhall ſee cauſe. He is to teach and inſtruct the Souldiers in the uſe of their Arms, and ſometime for their eaſe, he may command every File-leader to draw forth his File, and to ſhew them their poſtures. By which means he ſhall do ſuch good ſervice to his Captain, that when he ſhall exerciſe them himſelf, he may find them more apter and readier to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his Commands; at which time the Lieutenant ought to be in the Reer, and to ſee all things there truly executed according to the Captains commands. He is in time of danger and great importance to adviſe with his Captain about the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Company; for knowing his Captains intentions and purpoſes before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, he may be the better provided to withſtand the furious onſet of the Enemy. He ought to have the Enſign, and all other Officers of the Company as near him as may be, there being often-times urgent buſineſs to make uſe of them as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall require. He muſt neither caſhiere nor puniſh any man in the preſence of his Captain, but ought to make him acquainted therewith, that he may puniſh the offender by committing him either to priſon, or cauſe him to give recompence to the party wronged.

                        <p>HE that is a Captain of a Company, ought in reſpect he leadeth the ſame, and is Chief, to appoint unto the Officers their ſeveral places, what Diviſions they ſhall lead, and where they ſhall march, and according to the number of Files to make his Diviſions anſwerable thereto, by dividing his Muskettiers as near as he can, the one half upon the right of the Pikes, and the other upon the left: for they being the Flankers, ought equally to be ballanced; but if there be an odd File, it ought to be contrived, and carried to the right. In the Van, Battail, or Reer, he muſt according to the number of his men, order his Officers places, and draw them off accordingly in as equal a way as they will afford. He is, as well as his own, to know all the ſeveral duties of his Officers, and to be a good Poſture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man himſelf, that when he ſees any of his Souldiers handling their Arms in an undecent and ſlovenly manner, he may the better reprove them for the ſame. And although many Captains regardeth them not, but leaveth them to be inſtructed by the inferiour Officers; yet it is a great deal of honour to him, when his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhall be taught by himſelf, they more cheerfully and confidently marching along with him, when as they perceive that he is throughly knowing in all things belonging to his charge. He ſhall do well to exerciſe his Company ſometimes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, teaching them how to fight upon all occaſions, whether it be to Front, Reer, or Flanks, or upon ſurpriſe of an <hi>Ambuſcado,</hi> or any other diſadvantage which may befall them, informing them how to fall off and rally again in good order. And at ſuch times he muſt couragiouſly and wiſely behave himſelf, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his Souldiers of hopes of Victory, caſting off all appearances of fear or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whatſoever, cheerfully animating his Souldiers to fall on, taking care, and making much of them, and not to forſake them until ſuch time they may be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by others. He is to have a fatherly care of his Souldiers, timely providing for the maimed, wounded, and ſick, ſuch helps and remedies as their preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions requires.

He ought to carry a very even hand over his Souldiers, and to be very courteous and kind unto them; yet with that reſtriction of familiarity, that he come not under contempt.

Moreover, he ought to be very religious, temperate, and diſcreet, faithful in his truſt, valiant in the field againſt the face of his enemy, and being beſieged in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Town or Fort, (for to preſerve his honour) never give his conſent for the yielding it up, until it be paſt hope, that there is no poſſibility to hold it out any longer.</p>

In their drawings up he may be permitted to have Pen, Ink, and Paper for to take an accompt of the ſeveral ſtrengths of the Captains Companies, and to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his men accordingly, and ought to give unto all the Officers of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment notes in writing of their ſeveral charges and places. In time of fight, or otherwiſe marching with the Regiment, he is to be on horſe-back, in regard he is the eyes, hands, and feet thereof: in time of Battail he is to ſee every Officer to perform his charge, and Souldier his duty, forcing and compelling them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if in caſe they turn their backs.

He ought to have ſome knowledge or information of the Country, whether it be long or ſtreight, thereby judging how to order his marching ſo, as he may not be diſturbed by the enemies Horſe, or Artillery. Being troubled with Baggage, if there be any difficult paſſage, he ought to be there preſent to prevent ſuch diſorders as may happen; giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for their placing and marching, as they may not be any hinderance to

The Enſigns ought not to retreat, unleſs their Colonel or he give leave: no Order at any time ought to be altered, but by him, in reſpect he giveth none but ſuch as he receiveth from the Colonel. It is his duty to ſpeak for Ammunition, as Powder, Bullets, Match; and for Victuals, if there ſhall be any want in the Regiment, which proviſions ought to be delivered unto him, and he to ſee it equally diſtributed unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies according unto the proportion given out.

To conclude, the greateſt affairs of the Regiment being carried forth by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, there is the leſs remaining to be ſpoken concerning him, but that he ſee all things duly obſerved throughout the Regiment, according unto ſuch orders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from thoſe which are above him.</p>

                        <p>IT concerneth every Colonel to take care that his Companies be full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat (if it may be) that they be well provided of Arms, and to take cognizance what Exerciſes are continually performed by them, communicating Orders, and commanding all Officers of his Regiment what is to be performed by each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany reſpectively, whenſoever they ſhall happen to be upon their March.</p>
                        <p>In the Head of his Regiment is his moſt honourable and proper place, and there he ought to be moſt frequent. He is to be ſubſervient to the Lord General, Lord Martial, and Serjeant-Major-General of the Field, to whom he is to pay like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and obſervance as he himſelf expecteth, (and that juſtly) from all inferiors to him. For from thoſe his ſuperior Officers, by him are received in charge all ſuch Orders as refer to the place of <hi>Alarms, Marchings, Imbattellings, Guards,</hi> or <hi>Convoys.</hi> Furthermore, it is requiſite that every Colonel ſhould acquaint himſelf at leaſt once every week, how and in what manner the Souldiers of his Regiment have deported themſelves in their ſeveral Quarters, by a due and ſtrict examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the qualities of all ſuch offences as have occurred, and been committed by the ſeveral and Diſtinct Souldiers under his command, hereby preparing every ſeveral miſdemeanor for a readier hearing before a <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> or <hi>Court-Martial;</hi> and this is eaſily effected by convening the Captains, or other Officers under them, at ſuch convenient times as may ſuit with his occaſions; every Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel being bound to make his appearance at each <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> as Aſſiſtant to the Lord Martial, and Preſident of the ſaid Council, for the hearing and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of all ſuch propoſitions and matters in queſtion relating to the Army.</p>
                        <p>In all matters of Advice and Counſel, but more eſpecially when any Stratagem, Siege, or intended Battail is in agitation to be put in action, the Colonel ever as one of the primary Field-Officers is ſummoned to conſult with the General, and with all freedom to deliver his opinion in all things that ſhall be there diſcuſſed, for the beſt advantage (as he ſhall conceive) for the deſigns in hand, how weighty and important ſoever, and to be ready to go upon any ſuch ſervice as ſhall be caſt into his charge to be executed by the major part of the ſaid Council, and to expreſs his obedience to his General, although it be a ſervice that correſpond not with his own opinion at the firſt, but being cleared by the larger number to be more conducing to the good of the Deſign, couragiouſly to undertake it, and faithfully to perform it.</p>
                        <p>In the quartering of his own Regiment, which is always ordered for Quarter in two grand Diviſions, regard is to be had that his own Lodgings be ever taken up in the moſt equal place between his grand Diviſions, that ſo he may with more facility and celerity diſpenſe and import his commands to either Party.

                        <p>MAps, with the right uſe and knowledge of them, are great helps towards the finding out of the beſt and moſt convenient ways. Skilful and expert Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Countrey, are moſt proper to be elected for Guides; and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for their better encouragement, and the Armies ſudden and neceſſary uſe of them, to have them liſted in Souldiers pay. For the finding out of the fitteſt and ableſt perſons for this employment, it is moſt eſpecially the duty of the Waggon-Maſters, who are to ſee and enquire certainly, that they be men known and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in all poſſible By-paths, Croſs-ways, &amp;c. That they be able to give an accompt of the diſtance of places, of the evenneſs and ſtraightneſs of them, whether they be plain or crooked, hilly or ſtony, and difficult for paſſage; what Rivers, Hedges, Ditches and Bridges lye in the way, and which way (if there ſhall be ſeveral ways) is the ſafeſt and ſhorteſt, which the nearer or farther to or from the Enemies Quarters, which more probable for their approaches, as likewiſe for Quarter; what Forrage, what Water is to be had, and how convenient the way is for Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. If it ſhall happen that theſe Guides may be choſen partly out of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and partly from the Country-men, and ſo any ſcrumple, jar, or difference happen in opinion, ſuch Officers and others as are beſt skill'd in thoſe parts and places, are either to reconcile the difference, or from the moſt probable intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to conclude upon the moſt convenient paſſages. In reſpect of the danger and great hazards, if not utter ruine, that the Guides ſometimes do, and often may draw the Souldiers into by treachery and falſe play, they are many times cauſed to ride haltered about the neck, to put them in mind of capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they ſhall miſlead the party they guide; but in caſe they diſcharge their truſt faithfully and ably, they ought to be as well rewarded for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as otherwiſe to be puniſhed for the terrour of others.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Of Military Watches.</head>
                     <p>HOw neceſſary theſe Watches are in all Armies, is evident to all men; the grand and chiefeſt care whereof, for order and direction, reſteth in the Serjeant-Major, who iſſueth out ſuch precepts therein to the Captains or Companies, as he himſelf before received from his ſuperior Officer; &amp; according to the ſaid precepts received, whether it be in Garriſon or Field, the work and duty required is to be performed either by Squadrons or ful Companies, having reſpect unto the ſtrength or weakneſs of the place to be guarded, and in ſuch places as are moſt likely for the Enemy to make his approaches in, and that there they be careful to fortifie the Guard above other places of leſs concernment; which muſt be obſerved by the Major, in ſurveying the Guards, and Guard-places, in his walking of the grand Round, and ſo, according as his diſcretion ſhall ſee fit, to take from the ſtronger places of Guard ſuch Souldiers as may ſupply the defects of the weaker.</p>
                     <p>The appointment of particular Guards unto particular Captains, is in the power of the <hi>Major;</hi> or otherwiſe, he commandeth the <hi>Serjeant</hi> of each <hi>Company</hi> to attend him at his Quarters at any hour of the day, as he ſhall think fit, where every one that is to do duty upon the Guard that night, taketh his lot in order, (which lots are ſhuffled together in an Hat) which directeth him upon what Guard to attend that night. This being done, all the Serjeants that have their direction for the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Guard, are to make a Ring, or Circle, according to their degrees in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niority. To the Senior of all which Company of Serjeants, the Major giveth the Word privately in his ear, who after the ſame manner paſſeth it to the next, and ſo from man to man unto the youngeſt, who whiſpers it in the ear of his Major, who ſends it back again in the former manner for ſecurities ſake, until it come to the ſenior Serjeant again, who then leaves it in the ear of his Major, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth all miſtakes for each particular Company.</p>
                     <p>The Guards being thus ſet in order, the Officers relieved ought to inform the Officers of the Relievers; of all the ſeveral duties of their ſeveral Guards, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Every Commander in Chief of that particular Squadron which he is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, leadeth up his own Squadron from the Parade to their appointed Guard, to which when they approach, the Officer in Chief delivers the Word to the Corporal, or his Lanſpaſſadoe, and they to their Superior Officers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:108706:109"/>The manner of relieving is by planting a guard of Pikes next to the Relievers, and adjoyning to them in the Reer a guard of Muskettiers, through whom the Relievers are to paſs, and the Relieved to march back to their Quarters. After all things thus ſet in order, the Captain of the Guard in perſon by ſtrict injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commandeth every man to his duty, from which no man either. Officer or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to depart without an eſpecial licenſe, and in all Alarms to ſtand cloſe and quietly to their Arms, expecting further inſtruction and command what they are to do. And all this time, and conſtantly, a Sentinel is appointed to guard the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Main-Guard.</p>
                     <p>Every Officer and Souldier in a Regiment is worthy of Honor, Pay, and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, according to his Merit and Seniority; and to this end there ought to be a perfect Liſt of the names and number of all particular Souldiers and Officers in every Squadron; which Liſt or Catalogue is to remain in the hands of the ſeveral Corporals or Lanſpaſſadoes; which Corporals are diligently to ſee what defects there are of all ſeveral neceſſaries in their <hi>Corps du guard,</hi> and to be careful that they be continually ſupplied; which he muſt do by information to his Major, and (in caſe of his abſence or neglect) to his Captain, who may inform the Governor, that all wants of Fire, Ammunition, or Lights be made good, and comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leated.</p>
                     <p>The Corporals according to order and precept given to them, are to diſpoſe of the ſeveral Sentinels, as well Pikes as Muskettiers, and to have an eſpecial care that they keep their Muskets prim'd and laden, and their Match cockt and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with their Pan guarded; which muſt be obſerved by their often viſiting the ſeveral Sentinels, to ſee that all things be in due order, and with ſilence, to the end that the Sentinels may always be heard, as often as occaſion is offered.</p>
                     <p>The Office of every Sentinel after he is placed upon his duty, and in his due po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture (according as is above declared) is to enquire of every paſſenger, or other that ſhall but ſtir, <hi>Who goes there?</hi> yea, though it be the Captain himſelf: and howſoever the remoteſt Sentinel from the <hi>Corps du guard,</hi> is to permit him with his Retinue to paſs; yet he is bound to have an eye upon them, till he approach the neareſt Sentinel to the <hi>Corps,</hi> who upon the like demand, is anſwered, <hi>The Captain of the Watch;</hi> which latter Sentinel commands him to ſtand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with a loud voice calls forth his Corporal, the Sentinel not ſtirring from his place or poſture, until the Corporal with his Sword drawn ſhall approach with a Guard of Muskettiers, who are to be all arm'd, and appointed, as the Sentinels, ready to preſent; whereupon the Corporal with one only Muskettier advancing, and perceiving him to be the Captain of the Watch indeed, is to give him the Word in his ear, having reſpectively caſt down the point of his Sword: afterward receiving further inſtructions from him, he conducts him to his furtheſt Sentinel. But if it ſhall appear that he be not the Captain, or the Corporal knowing him not juſtly to be ſo, by a juſt ſuſpition, he may then detain him (although he ſhal give him the Word) and then he ſhall further demand the Word of ſome other atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, from whom having received it, he may more ſafely permit them to paſs; but of all others whatſoever that ſhall attempt a paſſage, he is to receive the Word from them, and not deliver it to them.</p>
                     <p>The Captain himſelf having done the duty in perſon of paſſing the firſt Round, upon his return, he is to ſend forth others upon the like duty, ſuch as he ſhall out of his diſcretion chuſe from his Main-guard, and may moſt confide in, to whom he is to impart the Word at their ſetting forth upon the duty, and not before, with ſtrict admonitions, and full inſtructions what they are to do, and what way to take.</p>
                     <p>Now if he ſhall be ſupplyed with men enough upon his own Guard, he may at the ſame time command out ſeveral Rounders to be taken ſeveral wayes; who are diligently to obſerve their directions given them, and to be very vigilant in the obſervation of all things in their paſſage, both by the eye and the ear, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the Sentinels (in caſe of neglect) that all things be more carefully lookt unto in their duty. And of theſe Rounders likewiſe (as before) the foremoſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel demands, <hi>Who goes there?</hi> When being anſwered ſatisfactorily, as by the name of the <hi>Round,</hi> or <hi>Friends,</hi> the permits them paſſage to the neereſt Sentinel,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:108706:109"/>
who having ſtopt them there, takes a further accompt, what, and who they are: Which is done by calling forth his Corporal, who placing the point of his Sword at one of their breſts, takes the Word privatly, and ſo paſſes them by conduct to the furtheſt Sentinel. But if there ſhall happen a miſtake in the Word, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral is either to ſecure them with himſelf, or by Guard to transfer them to the Main-guard.</p>
                     <p>Such as ſhall walk the Round, are to take a ſtrict accompt of all they meet, what, and who they are; and in caſe of deficiency of anſwering juſtly on the one ſide, or ſuſpition of the other, they are to ſecure and guard them to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Watch.</p>
                     <p>Now ſetting aſide thoſe Queries which ſome do make between Rounders and Counter-Rounders, if they meet, who ſhall give or take the Word; the beſt and ſafeſt courſe is for them all, that before the Word be either given or taken, they go together to the neereſt <hi>Corps du Guard,</hi> and there to give the Word; after which they are to paſs upon their duty again; and ſo having finiſhed the Round, and returning to the Captain of the Watch, he taketh accompt of them of the things that they have done and obſerved in their duty and courſe upon the Round; and thus the Captain ſtill ſupplies the Rounds ſucceſſively by ſuch others as he ſhall take by ſeniority, and diſpoſe off for the like ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, that all diſorders, irregularities, and ſuch perſons as ſhall cauſe the ſame in a Town or Garriſon, may be found out and rectified, and that all dangerous accidents by fire or otherwiſe may be prevented; the Captain of the Watch commandeth out a Guard of Firelocks or Muskettiers, to view the Streets, and all ſuſpitious and irregular perſons as they take, they are to bring to the Main-Guard of this Guard, which is always conducted by a Serjeant, and is called the <hi>Patrouille:</hi> and if they happen to be Muskettiers, and not Firelocks; then they are to be every one provided of ſuch an inſtrument as may cover the lighted Matches, and keep them from diſcovery. From theſe alſo, as from the Rounders, the Captain of the Watch takes full accompt of all their paſſages and obſervations on their duty.</p>
                     <p>When at any time any ſudden approach ſhall be made, or any Enemy diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Sentinel (who is to be firm &amp; conſtant to his Place and Poſture, till he ſhall be relieved) forthwith by firing gives the Alarm, and immediately ſeconds it by crying with a loud voice, <hi>Arm, Arm.</hi> When the Alarm is thus given, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Diviſions immediately led by their Officers, are orderly to march up to the Captain of the Main-Guard, to the intent that all Guards of the Garriſon may with expedition be made good; and it is neceſſary that theſe inſtructions be given them indeed by the Serjeant-Major, when he ſhall give the Word to the Minor-Serjeants, who muſt likewiſe inform their chief Officers of it, and from them the Souldiers are to be charged and acquainted therewith, that ſo upon all occaſions they may not be ignorant of this part of their duty, but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to perform it.</p>
                     <p>The duty of a Sentinel, is to ſtand in the Place and Poſture, a full hour, and no more; at which time the Corporal, or (in caſe of his abſence) his Lanſpaſſadoe is to relieve him, and not onely him, but all the Sentinels that are out upon du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, relieving the fartheſt Sentinel firſt (who falls in the Reer of the reſt) and ſo all the others backward in the like Order, and then conducts the relieved Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels back to the Guard again.</p>
                     <p>At an early hour of the morning appointed for beating up the Revally, the two Sentinels next unto the Guard are to retreat into it.</p>
                     <p>At the time appointed in the morning for opening of the Gates, the Serjeant-Major attended with a ſufficient Guard, repairs to the Governour, or place elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where alotted, and there receives the Keys; which being done, he is to unlock firſt that Gate which is moſt remote from danger of the Enemy, and the reſt in order anſwerable: but if it happen to be in place and time of imminent danger, the Major commandeth forth a party of Souldiers conducted by an able Officer to go firſt, and make diligent ſearch for diſcovering of Ambuſcadoes, which may happen to be in any cloſe ſuſpected places, as Lanes, By-ways, Hedges, ruinous
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:108706:110"/>
Cottages, Churches, Pits, or Hollow-trees, Woods, Gardens, and all ſuch-like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures; at which time he openeth not the Main-ports, but only the Wickets. And except upon command to the contrary, which is not uſual, both the Guards and the Watches at the Gates are to be kept night and day, and all perſons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to continue upon their duty until they ſhall be relieved by order.</p>
                     <p>Upon the diſcharging of the Watch, to the end that every Officer and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier may have notice to make ſpeedy repair to their ſeveral Guards, each ſeveral Drum firſt beats a Troop, and afterwards a March in the Main-guard. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, it is to be ſuppoſed the Relievers are advanced toward the Main-Guard, where the relieved are to be drawn off, and to make a ſtand, expecting till the Relievers ſhall come up; which being done, the relieved then are to troop home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and after that they have attended and ſeen their Colours lodged, they are to disband, and not before.</p>
                     <p>And now, further to ſatisfie the expectation of the Lovers of the <hi>Art Military,</hi> it ſhall not ſeem unſeaſonable here to declare ſomewhat concerning the manner of Field-Watches, or <hi>Vigils de Campe,</hi> denoted unto us by the Expert and Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, under theſe three Notions. The firſt are <hi>Caſtra temporanea, aleager ad placitum,</hi> pitcht onely for the preſent, and may perhaps alter and change it's Station in a day, or an hour, according to the pleaſure and judgement of the General, and Commanders in chief. Secondly, there are <hi>Caſtra,</hi> a ſelect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Camp, ſo called, becauſe of their intentions of continuance in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging of a Caſtle, or Town, &amp;c. until they ſhall have taken the ſame, or by ſome other neceſſity, or further advantage, forced to raiſe their Seige. The third and laſt, called <hi>Caſtra,</hi> Such a Camp as is pitcht before or neer ſome Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſide, to oppoſe and fruſtrate the Incurſions of the Enemy, who otherwiſe might this way break in for the infeſting or taking of a Country.

                        <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> The ordering of a private Company unto a Funeral-occaſion.</head>
                     <p>WHen any Commander or Souldier of worth ſhall be deceaſed, a private Captain that would ſhew reſpect and honour by marching along with his Company attending the Corps to the place of burial, muſt order his Souldiers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner.</p>
                     <p>They being ſummon'd by beat of the Drum, to meet at their uſual place of Rendezvous, they may be drawn up according to the uſual manner, having a Van-guard, Battail and Reer-guard: being thus ordered, and each of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers having either in his Hat a black Feather or Ribbin; the Captain may draw them off, and order them to their Long-march; moving them away in an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner unto the place of him that is deceaſed, and there make Alt. After which he may command the Muskettiers in the Van to open to the right and left outward to ſuch convenient diſtance as the Pikes may move up between them, and take poſſeſſion of their firſt ground; and thoſe Muskettiers may face about, and move down cleer of the Pikes, and after cloſe their Files inward to Order, and face to their Leader.</p>
                     <p>Now being in two Diviſions, let them ſo continue with their Arms ordered,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:108706:110"/>
until ſuch time as they ſhall perceive the Corps to be brought forth into the Street; then the Captain may face them all about, and move them ſome three Pikes length before the Corps; after which he may command his Muskettiers to perform their Funeral-Poſture, which is to have their Muskets under their left Arm, with the But-end upward, their Reſts likewiſe on that ſide trailing. After which the Pikes are to face again to their firſt Front, and to lay the narrow end of their Pikes down upon the ground; after facing about to the left, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the But-end of their Pikes on their right ſide, conforming themſelves with the Muskettiers in their Funeral-Poſtures. In the next place, the Enſign ſtrips his Colours off from the Staff, and ties them about his right Waſt; putting a black Ribbon towards the very end of his Staff, he after faceth to the Body of Pikes, ſtanding in the Reer of them, and trailing his Staff in the ſame Poſture. Next followeth the Captain, having in his hand a Half-pike or Leading-ſtaff, conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf likewiſe to his Funeral-Poſture. Thus being all ready to march, and rightly faced toward that place where the Corps are to be interred, are after this manner following to lead and to bring up.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Diviſion of Muskettiers, which was the Reer-guard, is led by the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant; the next Diviſion of Muskettiers, that was formerly the Van-guard, is led by the ſecond Serjeant; the Body of Pikes, is led by the eldeſt Serjeant, he trailing a Half-pike upon the head of them; the Enſign bringing it up, and the Captain twelve foot ſhort of him bringing up the Reer of the whole Company. And after him the Miniſters marching juſt before the Coffin; &amp; in the Reer, &amp; next unto it, the neereſt kindred, and after them thoſe that are invited to the Funeral.</p>
                     <p>Having thus ſtated the manner and order of the Military Part, with all others belonging thereunto, for any ordinary Funeral-occaſion; I ſhall in the next place proceed to ſhew their Order upon the March, and how each Arms ought to be diſpoſed before the Corps enter into the Church, with the reſt of the Train.</p>
                     <p>All perſons being ordered as before expreſſed, the Drums being covered with Black-bays, and placed betwixt the ſecond and third Ranks in each Diviſion; and all being ready to move, the Drums may begin to beat their Funeral-March, and the Lieutenant leading them away, with the But-end of his Pattiſon upward and comported; the reſt following, and marching in a leaſurable and ſlow way along together, until they come within a hundred foot of the Church-door, or place where the Corps are to be interred, there making Alt. After which, let the Muskettiers in their Ranks File to the right and left, not advancing ground; and face in oppoſition, making a Guard for the reſt to paſs through, and reſting their Muskets, or putting the But-end thereof to the ground, with the Barrel towards them (which is a conformity to the Pikes being ordered.) In the mean time, let the Pikes advance their Arms, and immediately after move forward betwixt the Guard of Muskettiers, and let their Ranks afterward file to the right and left, making alſo a Guard, their Pikes being ordered, and they as the reſt, facing in oppoſition. Then let the Captain, who brings up the Reer of all his whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, move forward with the reſt to the Church-door; then falling off in reſpect of ordering his Company, the reſt of the Train Marching into the Church.</p>
                     <p>After which the Captain may cauſe them all to face to the Church, or to their Leader; he ſtanding then before the Church-door, commanding them to Rank again as they were. After every Leader may draw off his File, and ſet their Arms apart in each File by themſelves, and go in to hear part of the Sermon, if there ſhould be any ſuch order before-hand from their Captain, placing Sentinels to look to their Arms. And when Sermon is almoſt done, they ought to go forth of the Church, and draw forth the Files by ſome little warning of Drums, to be in readineſs to anſwer ſuch directions as they ſhall receive from their Captain; who may, if he have conveniency of room, draw all his Muskettiers into a Ring, and the Pikes in like manner on the outſide of them; and as ſoon as the Souldiers have notice (being all ready and preſented) that the Body is laid down in the grave, they may upon warning of the Drum, give one volley of ſhot all together, and after make ready again, performing the ſame twice over more. After which, the Enſign may put his Colours upon his Staff, and furl them up; then the Pikes may be drawn up again into one Body, and the Muskettiers into another; and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108706:111"/>
falling in the Reer of the Pikes, they may troop away. And a little before the place of lodging the Colours, they may make Alt, and the Muskettiers may ſleeve up by the outſide of the Pikes from the Reer, filing to the right and left, making a Guard for the Colours and Pikes to march through them; and being cleer, and the Colours lodged, they may face about again to the right, and give another volley of ſhot: but if there ſhould be ſuch a ſtreight of ground, that the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers cannot be drawn into a Ring; then they muſt be otherwiſe diſpoſed of, by making them into two Ranks, the one on the one ſide of the Street, and the other on the other ſide, facing them either in oppoſition, or in an oblique man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: if in oppoſition, they muſt preſent very low, and give fire three times all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as before, with one volley after another; if oblique, the one Rank is to be faced towards the upper end of the Street, and the other towards the lower end, and ſo may fire with leſs danger to each other; the Pikes to be filed away to the right and left, behind the Muskettiers before they were thus faced. And again, where they have not length of ground to contrive the Muskettiers into two ſingle Ranks, they may fire all together as they ſtand at Order, mounting up the Muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles of their Muskets into the Air, without offending each other. Therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conveniency of the ground, it muſt be the diſcretion of every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to order his men accordingly to perform his three volleys of ſhot in the moſt gracefulleſt way; which being ended, they may all return to their Quarters. And thus much may ſuffice for ſatisfaction to any Commander in ordering his ſingle Company to any Funeral-occaſion, marching along of it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>WHen Companies are to march in a Regimental-way, care muſt be had that the Regiment be firſt drawn up according to this Rule. The Pikes to be in one Body, and the Muskettiers equally divided to flank that Body; after which let the Major make his Diviſions, appointing the places of every Captain and Lieutenant, where they ſhall lead, and where they ſhall bring up. After that they may move away towards the place or lodging of him that is to be interred, and there make Alt, opening the Van-guard or Muskettiers, and facing them to the Reer; then let the Body of Pikes and them interchange ground, that the Pikes may march next the Hearſe, in manner as before expreſt of a private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whoſe ſmaller Bodies take Rule from the greater. Then let the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonel lead the Regiment, and the Colonel bring it up; and ſo in like manner in every Diviſion, the Bringers-up are to lead, and the Leaders to bring up. All Officers and their Arms being thus reverſt, the Front becomes the Reer, and the Reer the Front, they muſt move ſlowly away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and before the Corps paſs into the Church, there muſt be ground reſerv'd, that after the Muskettiers have firſt made a Guard, the Pikes may move through them, and may alſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner file in their Ranks as the Muskettiers did, joyning to them, and making a Guard in like manner of each Arms. After which the whole Train may paſs through in an orderly manner into the Church; the Souldiers in the mean time attending without until Sermon be paſſed over. And being all in a readineſs, they may give three ſeveral Peals, or Volleys of ſhot, according to ſuch warnings as ſhall be given them. After which the Souldiers being ranked again as they were, if they have conveniency of ground, the Major may cauſe the Captains to draw off their Companies, and troop home to their ſeveral Quarters, according to their beſt conveniency. But if they have not room, it will be moſt propereſt for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor to command the Muskettiers to ſtand, and firſt to rank the Pikes again as they were. Then let the Drums beat a Troop upon the head of the Pikes in the Reer of the Colours; and let the Enſigns and Pikes firſt troop away, through the Guard of the Muskettiers; who being cleer of them, and being led by the Colonel and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers there appointed, the Muskettiers may alſo rank again in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and fall in the Reer of the Pikes, following them until they come unto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place or ground for the Captains drawing off their Companies, as they ſhall receive order from the Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel or Major. And here I will conclude my Diſcourſe concerning the Exerciſing of the Infantry in all their Military Motions and Exerciſes.</p>

places, where they are trained up, until by degrees they arrive unto perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but may delight and confirm the moſt able and moſt knowing Souldiers, whilſt here they read over thoſe ſeveral forms, in which heretofore they ſtood, when in ſo many Battails, with ſuch admirable ſucceſs they have both oppoſed and overcome their Enemies. And whereas even from hence may be extracted many excellent Directions and Rudiments of War, which may incourage and fully inable all active and gallant Spirits in this City of <hi>London</hi> to perform ſuch Commands, and to follow thoſe Conducts to which they ſhall be diſciplined by thoſe exquiſite and moſt expert Souldiers, who ſhall train them up, either in the new Artillery, or any other ground of ſuch Honorable Imployment, and hereby be ſo fitted and furniſhed with all directions, that the performance of them ſhall render them moſt acceptable: yet I cannot but confeſs, that through the uſual va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of this moſt Noble Profeſſion, proceeding from the great plenty which theſe times afford thereof (the exerciſe of Arms being every where ſo frequently ſhown) that the moſt plain and ordinary Rules, though far more uſeful, are not ſo well relliſhed, many men looking more in ſuch your publick Trainings after novelty and delight, then ſolidity; which was purpoſely contrived by the Authors of it only for variety, and for drawing of one another to the love of Arms, and not for any prejudice to the Fundamentals of War, on which the Ruine or the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Kingdom and Commonwealth of the World depends. If peradventure it be alleadged, that he who can perform things of difficulty, will be more apt to carry on things of more facility: It may be ſpeedily anſwered, that the plain Rudiments and Principles of War, being of greateſt uſe and importance, and practiſed in all Armies, both in this and other Nations, they are by no means to be neglected or omitted, but to be preſerved and eſteemed in that high manner which they do deſerve; for the ability in the performance of them, will no doubt more readily prefer a man, and render him more capable of any imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the practice of any uſeleſs or impertinent things in War. Add unto this, that the more eaſie and plain a man is in his command, the more readily it is received by the Souldiers, and more promptly obeyed; for new coined, and Seſquipedalian words of Command do ſo puzzle and torment the apprehenſions with directions and expoſitions to have them underſtood, that not only they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes tranſcend the reach of thoſe that are to give them; but they do much amaze and confound the capacities of thoſe who are to be led and ordered by them. I do the rather make mention of this in this place, that a diſcreet care be taken, that no man make himſelf ridiculous in his undertakings or Commands; but that he may be able to give an abſolute account of any Branch, which in the whole Body of the Art Military ſhall be propounded to him, to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therein to any judicious Souldier, as concerning the uſe, purpoſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of it; for otherwiſe it would ſignifie nothing at all. But when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required thereunto can render a ſufficient reaſon for what he doth, or ſhall voluntarily give it himſelf, as to this or that management of any ſervice in War, it will very much both content him, and inform them who ſhall be under his Command, and give them a juſt encouragement to proceed in it: but if he ſhould fail in this point of Knowledge and Judgment, there is but little benefit to be expected from his Conduct; for it were far better that a man did but a little in a Souldierly way, which is proper, and carrying good approbation to men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, then to ſpin forth a long thred with new expreſſions and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are of no uſe or profit, but tend rather unto laughter, and to the loſs of time, and the offence of many, and to the bringing of a generall contempt upon the Art.</p>
                  <p>And although there be many Rules which may be ſufficient forms to direct, and to teach to be expert in War, and doubtleſs are of great concernment to them who have both the. Theorick and the Practick part; yet nevertheleſs there is no rule, but at ſome time or other doth admit of ſome exception, there being eſpepially ſo many croſs events in War, that no Commander can poſitively tie himſelf up to any Rule; for occaſions do vary ſo in ſeveral places, that the chiefeſt Rule a man can walk by, is his Eye, and his Intelligence, wherein accordingly he
<pb facs="tcp:108706:112"/>
muſt accommodate himſelf to encounter his Enemies. And although a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander ſhould be qualified with much Knowledge, Courage and Faithfulneſs, the only accompliſhments of a true Souldier; yet they are to be attended with diligence; for in all his undertakings and performances, delays being always dangerous, it is uſually ſaid, <hi>That which is ſoonest done, and well done, is beſt done.</hi> But above all, he is to have an eye to order, which is the very life of an Army. And in acting againſt an Enemy, great care is to be taken not to puzzle the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, by confounding their underſtandings, which may occaſion their utter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow. And this makes me to reflect on what hath been mentioned hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Let every Commander that truly delights in Military exerciſes, ſtudy to be exact in all plain things, and practice the Souldiers much in the exerciſe thereof; for this is the only uſe, and is altogether practiſed and obſerved in the Field. If a man will be curious in new fancies, there are ſtratagems enough to be found out, in which he may exerciſe himſelf with much variety, to delight the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and find much matter in them to be highly valued, and eſteemed. But this is to be carried on in a plain way, the ſtudy whereof would ask ſome time; and it is not eaſily obtained by ordinary capacities, which ſhould content themſelves to learn of ſuch who are of higher abilities. And on this account the Art would be more highly prized, and not only bring more Honour to the Profeſſors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but even the Learners themſelves would become more capable of good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment abroad, and our Military Gardens and Meetings would much more flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and be beheld with more delight and ſatisfaction, not only by the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themſelves, but all other Spectators whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>I do not deſire to be miſ-underſtood by this Diſcourſe, that herein I ſhould go about to ſtartle any ingenious Souldier, or diſſwade him from any thing that ſhall be new to his Invention, which is proper: I ſhall rather incourage him, and be glad to underſtand of him what Reaſon he can give for every thing he doth, and of what uſe it may be unto the Publick, and then it will admit of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulment. But vacant ſeaſons may be uſed for variety and delight, in making experiments of wit, fancy, and ingenuity; provided they do not dwell too much upon them. But the ſubſtantial and ſolid things of War are above all things to be preciſely regarded, without which an Army, though of the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men, will be expoſed to the greateſt dangers, and fall into a moſt certain Ruine.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould here humbly offer my Advice to the moſt eminent Meetings in the Artillery and Military Gardens, in the latter of which I was heretofore a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſtill am a true Lover, and honourer both of that, and all other places like unto it: My advice is, that on their days of publick Meeting, they would have chiefly before their eyes the main Grounds and Principles in the Art of War, which (through permiſſion) I am perſwaded, would cauſe greater appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and make their Ground to flouriſh more then ever; to the Honour of our Nation, and the increaſe of experienced and able Commanders, if ever this Commonwealth ſhould ſtand in further need of them. And becauſe the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome doth ſtrive to aim at higher things in their thoughts then what is practiſed abroad, I have thought good to ſet down the plain way of exerciſing a Company, as uſually it is practiſed in the Army, our Companies conſiſting of one hundred men, two parts being Muskettiers, and a third Pikes, the depth of our Files being always ſix deep in the Armies of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> the Company being drawn up abreſt, the Exerciſe is as followeth, they ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their cloſeſt Order in Ranks and Files.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Bring all the Muskettiers before the Pikes, then let them fire in the Front, falling off, and flank the Pikes upon the Right. Fire upon the right flank, the body marching, and the Muskettiers to paſs on the left flank: after the Pikes may charge to the right, the body moving again. Let the Muskettiers fire on the left flank, and fall in the Reer of the Pikes, who may after charge their Pikes on the left. The body marching, the Muskettiers may fire in the Reer, and fall off to the Right and Left, and flank the Pikes as at the firſt; the body facing about, the Pikes may charge to the Reer. We uſually fire in the Front ſometimes two ranks ſtanding, the reſt paſſing by turns; then ſtanding after they have gained the ground before their Leaders, do fire, till all have fired twice: other times three Ranks fire together; the firſt kneels down, the ſecond ſtoops, the third ſtands upright; then falling down, the three laſt Ranks paſs through, and do the like. This being done twice, reduces them all as at firſt, the Pikes moving ſlowly; this being the uſual way of exerciſing our Companies in the Army.</p>

                  <p>HAving now an opportunity of reprinting the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Treatiſe of <hi>Military Diſcipline,</hi> written by Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Richard Elton,</hi> containing the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>Foot-companies, Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Brigades,</hi> &amp;c. I thought it not convenient to let the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry</hi> March into the Field of the [World] any more, without the <hi>Cavalry,</hi> nor they without their <hi>Train of Artillery:</hi> I have therefore endeavoured to make good the words of the Title, namely <hi>[The Compleat Body of the Art Military]</hi> by adding the following Treatiſes: wherefore, to the <hi>Infantry</hi> here is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Cavalry,</hi> and Inſtructions for them, both in <hi>Poſture</hi> and <hi>Motion;</hi> and for both, here is provided <hi>Quarters;</hi> and for the ſecuring of the <hi>Quarters,</hi> we have ſurrounded them with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, Redoubts, Bulwarks, Hanworks,</hi> &amp;c. and for the defending and maintaining of theſe <hi>Works,</hi> we have brought hither our <hi>Great Artillery.</hi>

                  <p>The additional Treatiſes in brief are theſe:</p>

                  <head>How the Officers of an Army in general ought to be qualified.</head>
                  <p>IN every Souldier (eſpecially a Commander) theſe eſſential qualities are required, <hi>viz.</hi> Knowledge, Experience, Valour and Dexterity; of which, how many are there that take upon them the profeſſion of a Souldier, that hardly know what any of the Words mean; but think their patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony a ſufficient Commiſſion for them, to take a Command upon them, they wanting Knowledge how to manage the men under their Command; Experience in the Art Military being a ſtranger to them. But certainly, if ſuch men did but ſeriouſly conſider how various and changeable the ſtate of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is, that in a moment he may looſe that honour and reputation he hath been many years obtaining, and ſeen the ignominie and diſgrace which ſome have come unto by their miſcarriages, they would doubtleſs be very cautious, and not run headlong into an imployment of ſuch importance.</p>
                  <p>But he that hath had experience by being under command for a time, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the degree of a Captain gradually, as from a Corporal to a Quarterma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, thence to a Cornet, and ſo to a Lieutenant; he is then well prepared for a Captains charge: for having paſſed theſe inferior Offices, depreſſeth thoſe vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſions which by nature otherwiſe are apt to ariſe in young men, which in a Commander are dangerous: Beſides, his accuſtoming himſelf to the former employments, maketh him Valorous; ſo that if he be ſuddenly aſſailed, he can recollect himſelf without aſtoniſhment; and to the forementioned Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons adde this, his accuſtoming himſelf to hardſhip, as to Watch, Travel, Labour, endure Hunger and cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His chief end muſt be Honour; to attain which, he muſt be vigilant, and let no opportunity ſlip to attempt any brave exploit or ſtratagem. And for that end he will be always obſerving his Enemy, and contriving how to circumvent him in his deſigns; knowing that in War no material matter can be effected without vigilancie and danger. But let him not always truſt to his own judgement, but adviſe with his Officers alſo; and upon any ſuch enterprize let him take to his aſſiſtance ſuch of his Souldiers as he ſees deſerve well, and quit himſelf at ſuch a time of the debauched part of his Souldiery. He muſt always aſpire to higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:108706:116"/>
of Honour. Let him hate Covetouſneſs: for nothing more will continue his Souldiers good affections towards him then Liberality. Gaming let him deteſt; and inſtead of gorgeous Apparel, let him delight in good Arms and Horſes. Let L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ry and Drunkenneſs be enemies to him, which his Souldiers perceiving, will be the more vigilant to rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>But above all, let him ſee before his eyes the fear of God, deporting himſelf internally and externally blameleſs. Thus by good Example of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the commanded will be reformed.</p>
                  <p>Having given you an account how every Commander in general ought to be qualified, I will now ſhew you the Office, Duty, and Qualification of every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in particular. And</p>

                        <hi>I.</hi> Of the General of the Horſe.</head>
                     <p>THe General of the Horſe was wont to ſupply the place of Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Army, and in the abſence of the Lord General to command the whole Army. It is true, that the Lord Marſhal, foraſmuch as he giveth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (according to the opinions of ſome) uſed to have the ſuperiority of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; whence it is, that the Lord General abſenting himſelf from the Army, uſed to take along with him either the General of Horſe, or the Lord Marſhal, to avoid competition between them.</p>
                     <p>He muſt be a man of Experience and Valour, having in charge the nerves of the principal Forces, and upon whom the ſucceſs of many deſigns and actions depend, they being uſually executed by the Cavalry, where the charging of the Enemy orderly uſually giveth Victory; and the diſorderly charging, diſturbs oft-times the whole Army. Witneſs that Battle at <hi>Gembloers</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> where the Infantry were overthrown by their own Horſe. He is to take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice not only of the Officers, but the private Souldiers alſo, rewarding them when vigilant, and upon ſome ſignal act advancing them to higher pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, and puniſhing Delinquents and ſuch as are deficient in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: by which means the good will love, and the bad fear him. He is to ſee the Cavalry be furniſhed with all neceſſaries, and be always in good equipage. A Troop being to march, he is to ſee that they be provided with Naggs, for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Souldiers Horſes; for with them they muſt go to forrage after their March, and preſently enter into Guard or Quarter without reſt, to refreſh their Horſes. The Captains are not to abſent themſelves from their Companies, nor to place of diſplace Officers without his leave and approbation. He hath his particular Officers a part; and in that which concerneth the Cavalry, neither Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal nor General himſelf diſpoſe of any thing without his advice. When he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through the Quarters either of the Cavalry or Infantry, his Trumpets are to ſound; but not where the Lord General is preſent, or where he lodgeth. When he commandeth in the Army (in abſence of the Lord General) upon occaſion of fight, his place is in the Battle, that he may the better give Order to all.

part with the Cavalry: he ought to be well verſed in the ways of the Country, that he may either meet or avoid his Enemy as occaſion ſhall required. He muſt be always buſied about his Enemies motion, conſidering with himſelf from what place they may ſhew themſelves, with what number, whether Infantry or Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; in what time they may probably come upon him, and where to place him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to advantage to prevent them.</p>
                     <p>He muſt be circumſpect and wary in the choice of the place appointed for Quarters, in preparing good Guards, cauſing the High-ways to be cleared, and by-ones diſcovered, placing men on thoſe places where he ſuppoſes the Enemy may make head; ſending forth Scouts continually, and placing Sentinels, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no diligence to ſecure the Quarter where the Cavalry findeth it ſelf to be expoſed to moſt danger, eſpecially if they be lodged without Infantry. He muſt be ſure to have Spies in and about his Enemies Quarters. He muſt look that the Captains wrong not their Souldiers, but that he ſee them well armed, and kept in good Order, and that they and his Officers obſerve good Orders and Diſcipline. As he ought to be ſevere in puniſhing, ſo he muſt be ready and willing to hear his Souldiers juſt complaints, and relieve them. He muſt not ſuffer any extortion to be uſed by himſelf or others, by which the Country is ruined, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery hated: for too great liberty of the Souldiers produceth bad effects.</p>
                     <p>He ought to be knowing in the command of the Infantry; for upon occaſion of ſending a good part of the Cavalry to ſeveral places, he hath the charge not only of the Horſe, but of the Foot alſo: And in the abſence of the General, the Orders from the Lord General or Lord Marſhal come to him, and to him are all reports made of the occurrences of the Cavalry and Army. He may ſuſpend a Captain of his command, upon juſt cauſe; but cannot reſtore him again without order from the General, who muſt firſt give notice thereof to the Lord General. When he paſſeth the Quarters of Cavalry, the Trumpets ſound; but not in the preſence of the General, or in his Quarters. When the General of Horſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the whole Army, and therefore takes his place in the Battle, the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General placeth himſelf in the Van-guard of the Cavalry, where otherwiſe the General uſeth to be.</p>

                     <p>A Captain ought to be a man Sober, Continent, and modeſt in his Apparel, aiming rather at good Arms and Horſes, then gorgeous Apparel; to ſee his Souldiers punctual in their reſpective Duties, and often calling them to exerciſe. Let him be generous, and not given to Gaming, leſt the Souldiers pay by that means be diminiſhed, which will overthrow his credit. He is diligently to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Orders he receives; and to be punctually ready with his Troop where appointed, himſelf being firſt on Horsback, ſeeing his Troop compleat and full before he march. He ought to know every Souldier in his Troop by name, that upon any Exploit he may draw forth ſuch as he diſcerns moſt fit for the buſineſs he hath in agitation. The Captains taking notice of a Souldier does very much animate and encourage him. He muſt cheriſh his well-deſerving Souldiers, and caſhier the idle and debauched. Let him always have 2 or 3 of his Souldiers well skilled in the Countrey, for they may ſerve him as Guides, for that thoſe of the adjacent Towns or Villages are not always to be had, nor is it at all times ſafe to intruſt them: to theſe Souldiers he is to contribute ſomething extraordinary beſides their pay.</p>
                     <p>Out of his Troop he is to chuſe his Lieutenant, Cornet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> impartially by their merit, and not for favour or affection; by which he ſhall be beloved of his Souldiers, and not be forced to alter his choice by the Generals Order.</p>

In the Captains abſence he commands the Troop. He muſt be diligent to ſee the Souldiers do their duties, and ſee that their Horſes and Arms be in good caſe. He is to bring up the Reer of the Troop, and ſee the Souldiers keep Rank, File, and Diſtance orderly after the Captain and Cornet, and to permit none to depart from the Body or Troop. In fight he is to be ſtill in the Reer with his Sword drawn, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the Souldiers, and cutting, if not killing ſuch as ſhall preſume to flinch. He is to keep a Liſt of the names and ſirnames of the Souldiers in his Troop, and know the ſufficiency of each Souldier, that he may make uſe of them accordingly.</p>
                     <p>The Troop being to go to Guard, when neer, the Lieutenant is to go before to the Lieutenant that is to be relieved, and take notice of the <hi>Corps-du-guard,</hi> and receive information from him, when and where the Sentinels are to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, what ways to clear, and all other things neceſſary; and he muſt viſit the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels often both by night and day, he firſt himſelf having placed them. If the Troop be lodged in a Village, the Billets muſt be ſigned by the Quartermaſter of the Troop, and diſtributed to the Souldiers before the Cornets lodging, where the Alto is made to attend the ſaid Billets; ſo that in caſe of an Allarm, the Souldiers may know whither to repair. If they ſtay longer then a day in one place, the Lieutenant is to viſit the houſes to ſee that the Souldiers keep good orders; and being to go away, to bid them be careful to put out their Fires. If they go to be lodged in a Town or Fort, and there to keep Garriſon, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant is to accommodate their Lodgings according to their degrees and deſerts; and whereſoever they lodge longer then a day, he muſt write the name of the Souldiers upon the ſaid Billets, that if the Souldier commit any Miſdemeanor, he may be the readier diſcovered and puniſhed.</p>

                     <p>IN the abſence of the Captain and Lieutenant, the Cornet is to command the Troops, but in the Captains preſence upon a March, his place is in the Front before the firſt Rank, but behind the Captain: in his charging of an Enemy, he is to charge with the Captain, and endeavour to break his Standard upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; and being broken, and falling to the ground, he is not to regard taking it up again, his honour lying much in the breaking of his Standard in chaſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Horſe or Foot: But if the Enemy ſhould take the Cornets Standard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken, it were to him a great diſgrace. And this is contrary to the practice of an Enſign in the Infantry, the preſerving of whoſe Colours is ever eſteemed his greateſt glory; as is evident in the Example of one <hi>Jaques Martaeus,</hi> who, when moſt of his Souldiers had forſaken him, he fought ſo long as he could; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf over-powred, wound himſelf up in his Colours and dyed.</p>
                     <p>The Cornet of Cuiraſſiers in march hath his place at the head of the Troop, and preſenteth himſelf in the Alarm-place; but in fight, in the midſt of the Troop, having two third parts of the Souldiers behind him. [And this is the place of his marching in theſe times, which does moſt agree with the manner of marching of the Infantry, where the Enſign marches before the diviſion of Pikes.] The Souldiers in the Front-diviſion of the Troop, muſt be thoſe beſt armed, and the moſt couragious. He muſt keep a Liſt of the Troop, and ſend ſo many to the Guard, as the Captain or Lieutenant ſhall appoint. Once every day, he is at the Lord-Generals paſſing by the Troop to do obeyſance to him, by inclining his body and Cornet towards the ground.</p>

ſo that you may have him to be ready at command, to pace, trot, gallop, to run in full carreer; alſo to advance, ſtop, retire, and turn readily to either hand, and all with alacrity and obedience.

Firſt upon his pace, then upon the trot, and ſo to the gallop and carreer. He may be taught theſe things by uſing the Hand, Leg, and Voyce: for the Hand (obſerving not to move the Arm, only the Wriſt) if you would have him to face to the Left, a little motion of the little Finger on that Rein, and a touch of the left Leg (without uſing the Spur) doth it. If to face or turn to the Left about, then a little harder. If you would have him to Trot, move both your Legs a little forward; for the gallop, more forward; and for the carreer, to yerk them moſt forward, and to move the Body a little forward alſo with it.

You muſt uſe him to the ſmell of Gun-powder, the ſight of Fire and Armor, the hearing of Shots, Drums, and Trumpets; all by degrees, and with diſcretion. When he is at his Oats, you may fire a little Gun-powder at a good diſtance from him, and ſo neerer by degrees: Afterwards a Piſtol at a diſtance, and ſo neerer by degrees; and in like manner may a Drum or Trumpet be uſed.

                        <p>For the more eaſie and ſpeeding lading of the Piſtol, for the gaining of time, and avoiding the carrying of either Flask or Touch-box, there is an invention of a Spanner or Key, which contains ſix Charges of Powder at the leaſt, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-Powder ſufficient for thoſe Charges, and for the Cartouches wherewith the Piſtol-caſes be furniſhed; which the Cuiraſſier will find to be of very good uſe.</p>
                        <p>The Cartouches are made of white Paper, cut into convenient breadth and length, and rowled upon the Rammer or other ſmall round ſtick; the edge being paſſed down, and the Rammer drawn out, one end of the Paper is to be doubled in, to keep the Powder from falling out: theſe Cartouches are to be made ſo big, as to fill neerly the bore of the Piſtol, and of length to contain as much Powder as the Piſtol requires for a Charge. When the Powder is in, tie it with thred, and then put in the Bullet alſo, tying that alſo; theſe the Souldier may make at ſpare hours, and have them always by him. When he uſes his Cartouches, he muſt bite off the Paper at the head of it, and ſo put it into the Barrel of the Piſtol with the Bullet upwards, and then ram it home: theſe being beforehand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, it will much expedite the work of lading his Piſtol.</p>
                        <p>The Cuiraſſier being well mounted, and throughly exerciſed in his Poſtures, the next thing he ſhould apply himſelf unto is, to be a good Marksman; to attain which, he muſt be frequently ſhooting at Marks on Horsback, having ſuch ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Tree, ſome higher and ſome lower.</p>
                        <p>The Cuiraſſier being armed Piſtol-proof, he muſt not give fire but at a very neer diſtance, being careful to make his Bullet do execution: the principal place of advantage to aim at is, the lower part of the belly of his Enemy, his arm-pits, or his neck. Some are of opinion, that it is not fitting for a Cuiraſſier to give fire, till he have his Piſtol under his Adverſaries Armor, or againſt ſome unarmed place; and if he miſs of an opportunity of hitting the man, he may aim at the head or breſt of his Horſe. He is commonly to give the charge upon a Trot, and ſeldome galloppeth, but upon a purſuit. Having ſpent both his Piſtols, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no opportunity to load again, he muſt then betake himſelf to the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, his Sword, placing the Pummel of it upon his right thigh, and with his
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:108706:120"/>
right hand to direct the point thereof by his eye, raiſing it higher or lower as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerveth, aiming at his Enemies Neck, Arm-pits, Eye, or about the Pummel of the Saddle at his Belly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but being paſt his Enemy, he is to make a back-blow at him, aiming to cut the buckle of his Poldron, thereby diſarming one of his Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>THe Dragoon is of ſpecial uſe and ſervice to aſſiſt the Cavalry as Infantry; for there be many conſiderable Exploits which cannot be effected by the Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alone.</p>
                        <p>The Muskettier muſt therefore exerciſe himſelf to give fire on Horsback. When they come to guard a Paſſage, or do other the like ſervice, they are to alight, and to demean themſelves as Infantry; and being alighted to do their ſervice, every of them is to caſt his Bridle over the neck of his Sides-mans Horſe, in the ſame order as they marched, keeping them ſo together, by ſome purpoſely appointed to attend them.</p>

                        <p>THe Horſman being ſufficiently inſtructed in the managing of his Horſe, and in the uſe of his particular Arms; it is time now that he be taught how to demean himſelf being joyned in a Body.</p>
                        <p>The Horſe being to be exerciſed, is to be drawn up into a Body, not by Ranks (as in the Infantry) but by Files, and thoſe of 5 deep, according to moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; or of 6 deep, according to others, that of 5 being a number not diviſible by 2, ſo that in doubling of Ranks, or Half-files, or the like, there will always remain an odd Rank. Others would have them (eſpecially the Harquebuſiers) to be 8 in File, making the Troop to conſiſt of 64 Men, being drawn up into a ſquare Body. Being thus put into Battalia, the firſt thing they are to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in, is Diſtance; and herein there is a diſagreement among Authors; Some making Cloſe order to be 2 paces; Open order 4 paces, and ſo forward to a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, quadruple Diſtance proportionable. Others make but two kinds of Diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Cloſe order, which is 3 foot; and Open order, which is 6 foot. And here a difference is to be obſerved between the manner of taking the Diſtance of the Cavalry, and that of the Infantry; for in the Foot, the Diſtance is taken from the Center, or middle of the Souldiers Body, which here cannot be underſtood but only of the ſpace of Ground between Horſe and Horſe. But the beſt and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Authors are of opinion, that the Cavalry being to be exerciſed in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhould be at their Diſtance of 6 foot or Open order, ſtanding right in their Ranks and Files.</p>

                        <p>Theſe and ſuch like Motions are directed and commanded by the Voice of the Commander; but becauſe the Voice cannot at all times be heard (eſpecially in groſs bodies) by reaſon of the claſhing of Armor, trampling and neighing of Horſes, tumultuous ſounds, and noiſe of the Multitude (and that eſpecially in fight) Antiquity hath invented helps, making three kinds of Military Signs or Directions: <list>

their Cornet, when to Troop away, when to give a Charge, when to retreat, when to attend the Watch, and the like. All which being the louder Voice of the Commander, they muſt perfectly obſerve and obey.</p>

                     <head>The Marching of an Army.</head>
                     <p>I Come now to let you ſee an Army of 22000. Foot, and 5000 Horſe, with thirty pieces of Ordnance, to wit, eight Half cannon, ſix Quarter-can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and ſixteen Field-pieces, march in a Country where they may be charged either in Front or Reer; then ſhall I give you ſome rules for paſſing of Straits and Rivers: And laſtly, I will ſhew you the form and Order that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> obſerved in ſome of his Marches.</p>
                     <p>You are to obſerve, that the Army is to be divided into Van-guard, Battail and Reer; and becauſe the Van is the moſt honourable place, they change eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, ſo that he that hath the Van this day, hath the Reer to morrow; and he that had the Battle, marcheth in the Van; ſo likewiſe he that had the Reer the firſt day, marcheth in the Van the third day: and this Order doth the Regiment in every <hi>Tertia</hi> alſo follow.</p>
                     <p>Being thus divided, they are all upon Order given by the General to ſtand ranged in Battalia, either in their ſeveral Quarters, or in ſome place of Arms ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the whole Army; and ſtanding ſo in readineſs, Command being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to March,</p>
                     <p>There ſhall firſt ſet forwards 500 Horſe, in one or more Troops, as occaſion ſhall require, to diſcover and cleer all the Paſſage that the Army is to march by; they ſhall advance an Engliſh Mile or more, according to the Quality of the Country, before the Army, and ſend a Corporal out of every Troop, which beſt knows the Country, with fifteen or ſixteen Horſe, to ſearch and ſcoure all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected ways; thoſe Corporals ſhall alſo advance as much before their Troops, as their Troops are before the Army, or thereabouts, according as the Country
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108706:126"/>
is opened or covered, and always keep three or four Horſe a Muſquet ſhot before them, to prevent any ſudden ſurpriſe; and if they diſcover any Enemies, they are preſently to ſend a Horſe-man to advertiſe their Troops, and they likewiſe to give notice to the Army.</p>
                     <p>They muſt alſo diligently inform themſelves, as neer as poſſibly they can with the ſtrength of the Enemy, and ſtill ſend Meſſengers with advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by whom they ſhall alſo receive Order, how they ſhall retire or diſpoſe of themſelves.</p>
                     <p>After them ſhall follow 1000 with Fire-locks and Half-pikes, divided into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Troops, as well to ſuccour the ſaid Horſe, as to guard the Ordnance of the Van-guard that follow; and they ſhall alſo ſend fifty men on either Flank, with ſufficient Officers to diſcover and keep off ſmall parties.</p>
                     <p>Then ſhall march two Companies of Pioniers, to even the way for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery; and with them one Waggon with Materials, and an other with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals.</p>
                     <p>Next eight Field-pieces all ready charged, and attended by two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, four Gunners, two Waggons loaden with Powder, two with Bullets, and one Conductor.</p>
                     <p>Then three Quarter-cannon likewiſe charged, and attended by one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, two Gunners, one Waggon loaden with Powder, one with Bullets, and one Conductor.</p>
                     <p>After them four Half-cannon upon their Carrages, attended by two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, four Canoniers, four Waggons loaden with Powder, four with Bullets, one with a Bucks head, and other Inſtruments neceſſary to mount and diſmount the Pieces, and two Conductors.</p>
                     <p>Next ſhall follow 2000 Horſe, marching in a good diſtance by Regiments or Troops, and in good Order.</p>
                     <p>After them the Van-guard of Foot conſiſting of 7000, and marching orderly by Regiments, at their appointed diſtances.</p>
                     <p>There ſhall follow them half the Ammunition and Victuals for the Army; then the Generals and Chief Officers Waggon; and laſtly, the particular Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons belonging to the Van-guard, and half of that which belongs to the battail, marching, and taking place in the ſame Order, as do the Regiments they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto in their ſeveral Bodies.</p>
                     <p>Then ſhall march the Battail, conſiſting likewiſe of 7000 Foot, followed with the reſt of the Ammunition, Vivers and baggage of the Battail; and alſo with that which belongs to the Reer.</p>
                     <p>After them ſhall march in well ordered Diviſions, the Reer of the Foot conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 6000 Foot, and next 2000 Horſe, as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>Then (in the ſame order as is mentioned in the Van-guard) ſhall march four Half-cannons, three Quarter-cannon, and eight Field-pieces accompliſhed with their appurtenances, as Powder, Bullets, neceſſary Inſtruments, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent perſons to manage and attend them.</p>
                     <p>Next them 1000 Fire-locks to guard the Ordnance, and ſuccour the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn-hope of the Reer, as is aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, (to cloſe up the Army) ſhall march 500 Horſe, obſerving the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as is preſcribed them in the Van-guard.</p>
                     <p>Many there are that diſlike the placing the baggage among the Troops, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Army is to paſs any narrow way or ſtraits, becauſe the Waggons take up ſo much ground, and ſeparate the Troops ſo far, that upon occaſion they will not be able to ſuccour each other; and it is certain, that an Army thus divided may eaſily be affronted: But there is no General ſo ill advertiſed, being to paſs a ſtrait, that hath not intelligence where his Enemy attends for him, whether it be in Front or Reer: And if his Enemy waits for him a head, he can let his baggage come in the Reer, next after the Reer of the Foot. If he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, he may place his baggage before the Van-guard of the Foot, ever taking care to appoint a ſufficient guard to attend it: and in an open Country,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108706:126"/>
where the Troops may march in Battalia, the Waggons may well march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Troops, placing themſelves likewiſe in Ranks, and making a Front as large as the Body they follow; ſo ſhall they take up but little ground, and be no trouble at all: and there they are out of danger, which otherwiſe they will be ſubject to, if an Enemy be neer, and ſtrong in Horſe.</p>

                     <head>The manner of paſſing a River.</head>
                     <p>IF you be to paſs a River, and that the Enemy be not at the Paſſage, but on his way to hinder you; Firſt, draw your Army in Battalia, and plant ſome pieces of Artillery in places moſt advantageous, to ſuccour your Troops in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; and if you find that he is ſtronger then you in Foot, let your Horſe paſs firſt over, and chuſe a fit place to ſtand neer the way that the Enemy is to come, and let them ſend ſome light-Horſe before to diſcover: then let your Van-guard of Foot with ſome Field pieces follow, and find a place to ſtand in Battalia; after it let the Battle march, and place it ſelf on the left hand of the Van-guard, then the Reer-guard, which ſhall likewiſe take the left hand of the Battle, each with their Field-pieces belonging to them.</p>
                     <p>The Troops being paſt, the reſt of the Ordnance with their Train ſhall follow, then the baggage of the great Officers; and laſtly, the baggage of the Troops in the order of March.</p>
                     <p>But if your Enemies chief ſtrength conſiſt in Horſe, then ſhall you ſend no more Horſe over then ſhall be fit for diſcovery; but let the Van-guard of the Foot paſs firſt, and after it the Horſe belonging to the Van-guard, which ſhall place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Battalia on the right hand of the Foot; then ſhall follow the Battle, which muſt ſtand on the left hand of the Van-guard; after it the Horſe of the Battle, which ſhall cover the Flank of the Battle, until the Foot of the Reer-guard be come up, and then they ſhall edge to the left hand, and leave room for the Reer to come in between them and the Battle, and ſtand on the left Wing, which is their due place; then ſhall follow the Horſe of the Reer, which muſt be divided indifferently between the two Wings; and laſt of all ſhall march the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, Ammunition and baggage in the order aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>If you be to paſs a River, and have an Enemy at your back, when you have made your Bridge, ſend over eight or ten Pieces, and place them in places moſt convenient to annoy your Enemy, if he offer to come to trouble you, and then caſt up a Horn-work, or fair half Moon upon the ſide you are on, and place therein five or ſix Field-pieces; then let the reſt of your Ordnance be drawn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and planted likewiſe on the other ſide in places moſt commodious for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage aforeſaid. After them ſhall follow your Ammunition and baggage; then the Horſe; and laſtly, the Foot in good order, bringing with them the Pieces left in the Works, which ſhall paſs ſafely under the Command of the Ordnance planted on the other ſide, and break up the bridge after them.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far proceeded, I ſhould in the next place let you ſee a Liſt of the Ammunitions, Materials, and other Warlike proviſions, which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> takes with him in Shipping when he goes to the Field; as alſo what he
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:108706:127"/>
takes out of it to be carried upon Waggons, when he marcheth by Land, with the Waggons thereto neceſſary. But ſince I have firſt ſpoken of the marching of an Army with eight half-Cannon, ſix quarter-Cannon, and ſixteen Field-pieces, I will ſet down what Ammunition and other things are needful to march with them, allowing every half-Cannon to ſhoot an 150 ſhot, every quarter-Cannon 100, and every Field-piece 80.</p>

But let the Ground be champion, the better to diſcern your Enemy at a diſtance; and if poſſible, neer ſome River, for the relief of Men and Cattle, and for the cheaper conveying of neceſſaries for the uſe of the Souldiery.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. See that the Ground you quarter upon be not at any time ſubject to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow with Water, nor that any Water be let in upon you by Sluſes or otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That no boggy, mooriſh, or unwholſome Grounds be neer your <hi>Quarters,</hi> which may be a means to bring Diſeaſes and Sickneſs among the Souldiers.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That Forrage, Wood, and Straw be neer you, or may be eaſily conveyed to you.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the <hi>Quarters</hi> be not too neer your Enemy, for fear of their Cannon; nor very far diſtant, but that timely relief may be given to the approachers.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That the Ground be of a competent largeneſs to contain the number of Companies, Horſe, Foot, Artillery, and other neceſſaries thereunto belonging, with allowance of fit dimenſions for every particular.</p>
                     <p>But it will rarely fall out that any place you can chuſe will have all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, wherefore gain as many of them as you can, and for the reſt you muſt by induſtry ſupply. Wherefore (above all) let the Fortifications and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments about your <hi>Quarters</hi> be well made and guarded, leſt by the neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them you be ſurprized, and your Enemy hinder your relief.</p>

                     <p>THis work is not to be done of a ſudden, but the Quarter-maſter knowing the place where the <hi>Quarters</hi> are to be, let him go to his Chamber, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with his Liſt which he is to quarter; namely, how many Regiments of Horſe, how many of Foot, what Waggons, what Artillery, and whatſoever elſe, as Sutlers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is to quarter; alſo how many Companies there is in each Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and how many men in each Company.</p>
                     <p>He having collected and gathered them all together in a Note, let him take ſome pieces of fine paſt-board, and cut them into pieces 300 foot (by ſome ſmall Scale) deep, and ſo broad as to contain the number of men of ſuch a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either Horſe or Foot, he is to quarter; allowing true diſtance, of Ground both for Hut, Paſſage, Stable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at that length let him cut off his paſt-board ſquare, and write upon that paſt-board the Colonels name, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men; and thus muſt he do for every Regiment both of Horſe and Foot.</p>
                     <p>In like manner for the Generals <hi>Quarters</hi> and his Retinue, for the Provoſt, Quarter-maſter, Miniſter, Chirurgion, and all others that require ſingle <hi>Quarters;</hi> and likewiſe for the Waggons and Sutlers. All theſe muſt he lay one according as he finds their Numbers greater or leſſer in his Liſt, and cut his paſt-boards accordingly, writing upon them as before.</p>
                     <p>His paſt-boards being thus prepared, let him upon a Table, or rather upon a

                     <p>By help of theſe parallel Lines he may lay his paſt-boards upon this paper, and move them this way and that way, till he have brought them into a Square, or <hi>Parallelogram,</hi> or as regular a form as they will permit.</p>
                     <p>He having thus diſpoſed them to the beſt advantage in his judgment, he may draw a Scheme or Plat thereof upon fair Paper or Parchment, writing the name of every Colonel and his number of men upon his particular <hi>Quarter,</hi> with the Generals <hi>Quarters,</hi> Market, Streets, Lanes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> making thereof a perfect Map; and adding a Scale thereto, he may meaſure the diſtance of any part thereof at pleaſure.

                     <p>Then the Quarter-maſter-General coming to the Field with a Surveying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, pitcheth it down at one of the angular points of his <hi>Quarter,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his ſights, ſetteth off a right Angle from the point where his Inſtrument ſtandeth, and meaſureth from thence with a Chain, the whole length of his <hi>Quarter;</hi> and at the end of that meaſure, he ſetteth up a Standard of the Colour o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:108706:131"/>
and going to his Inſtrument, he cauſeth another Standard to be erected there, of the Colour of the Regiment that is there to be quartered.</p>
                     <p>Then removing his Inſtrument from this firſt place, let him carry it to any of the other Standards, and there place it; laying his Index and ſights upon the Diameter thereof, and turning it about till he ſee his Standard that was ſet up where his Inſtrument laſt ſtood; then fixing it there, turn the Index to a Right-angle, and looking through the ſights, meaſure out the length or bredth of your <hi>Quarters</hi> that way, and at the end of that meaſure ſet up a fourth Standard, of the colour of the Regiment there to be quartered.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Let the Ground made choice of for the <hi>Quarters</hi> be <hi>Q;</hi> then the Quarter-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter coming into the Field, makes choice of the Point <hi>A</hi> for one of the Angles of his <hi>Quarters;</hi> and there erecting of his Inſtrument, the Index lying upon the Diameter thereof, he directs his ſight to <hi>B;</hi> and becauſe the length of his <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> are to be 3000 foot, he cauſeth ſo much to be meaſured out from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>B;</hi> and at the point <hi>B</hi> cauſeth a Standard to be rected of the Colours of that Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is to be quartered in that Angle. Then going to his Inſtrument, let him turn the Index about to a right Angle from the line <hi>A B,</hi> and looking through the ſights towards <hi>C,</hi> let him cauſe 1700 foot (the breadth of his <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>) to be laid out upon the ground from <hi>A</hi> to D, and at <hi>D,</hi> let them cauſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Standard to be erected, of the Colours of the Regiment that is there to be quartered.</p>
                     <p>This done, let him remove his Inſtrument from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>D,</hi> and at the place where his Inſtrument ſtood, let there be erected another Standard. The Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being placed at <hi>D,</hi> and the Index laid upon the Diameter thereof, let him turn the Inſtrument about, till through the ſights he ſee the Standard at <hi>A,</hi> and then fixing it there, turn the Index about till it be removed a right Angle (or 90 <hi>deg.</hi>) from the Diameter; then looking through the ſights, cauſe 3000 foot to meaſured from <hi>D</hi> to <hi>C.</hi> Laſtly, remove your Inſtrument to <hi>C,</hi> and laying the Index on the Diameter thereof, turn it about, till through the ſights you ſee the Standard at <hi>D,</hi> and fixing the Inſtrument there, remove the Index to a right Angle from the Diameter; and then looking through the ſights (if you have
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108706:132"/>
performed the former work truly) you ſhall exactly look upon the Standard which was firſt erected at <hi>B,</hi> and the diſtance between <hi>B</hi> and <hi>C</hi> being meaſured, ſhall be found to be exactly 1700 foot.</p>
                     <p>Thus are the four grand Angles of the Quarters found in the Field. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with any of the Regiments that are to be quartered in any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, as with that at <hi>B,</hi> look in your Draught, and ſee how many foot in length is allotted for it, which is 676; then meaſure that out from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>O,</hi> and ſet up a Standard there; then ſee how many foot broad that Quarter is, <hi>viz.</hi> 300, and meaſure that out from <hi>B</hi> to <hi>K,</hi> and there alſo ſet up a Standard. Then the length 676, and the bredth 300, being meaſured both ways from <hi>K</hi> to <hi>S,</hi> and from <hi>O</hi> to <hi>S,</hi> then erecting a Standard alſo; theſe two laſt Standards at <hi>O</hi> and <hi>K,</hi> will finde the place where the fourth Standard at <hi>S</hi> is to be erected. So is the ground laid out for one of the Angular Regiments; the like muſt be done for the other three, and alſo for all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoon as any <hi>Quarter</hi> for a Regiment is laid out by the Quarter-maſter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the particular Quarter-maſter of that Regiment begins to ſubdivide his <hi>Quarter</hi> according to the number of his men, putting down a ſtick at each end of every row of Huts and Streets end.</p>
                     <p>Then the Serjeants of every Company preſently fall a dividing the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Huts, and ſet up four ſticks at the corner of each Hut: then the two Souldiers that lodge together build their Huts; and ſo the reſt.</p>
                     <p>In the Souldiers building of their Huts, the Serjants are to ſee that they build them regularly, and not incroach one upon another, but as their Ground is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted them. And to this the Superior Officers alſo are to have an eye.</p>
                     <p>What is hitherto delivered, I ſuppoſe, is plain enough to be underſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a farther addition either of Words or Schemes; the Figures and Directions here delivered being ſufficient (in my judgment) to give full ſatisfaction to the Reader.</p>

                     <p>At this 206 foot diſtance, the Pioniers dig a Trench or Furrow of about half a foot broad, and ſo much deep.

                     <p>Then the Enginier is to conſider how many foot of Ditch there is about the whole <hi>Quarters,</hi> and with that number goes to the Quarter-maſter-General, and enquires of him the number of the Infantry; and by theſe two they compute how much of the Ditch each Regiment muſt dig: thus,</p>
                     <p>If the number of ditching be 7500 foot, and the number of the Infantry is 8560.</p>
                     <p>Now ſuppoſe one Regiment contain 1320 Souldiers, how much of that Ditch muſt that Regiment dig?</p>
                     <p>Multiply 1320 by 7500, and it produceth 99100. which being divided by 8560 giveth 1157 and about three quarters, and ſo many yards muſt that Regiment dig which hath 1320 men in it.</p>

                     <p>THe reaſons that moved the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to remove the Captains from the Front, and place them as they are lodged in this laſt Quarter in the Reer, I take to be three; Firſt, becauſe the Souldiers upon any ſudden occaſion, could not readily draw out into the Alarm-place, by reaſon of the narrow Streets between the Captains Huts. Secondly, becauſe the Colours and Arms lay hid by the Captains Huts, which now ſtand open in the eye of the Alarm-place, and make a handſome ſhew, being likewiſe readier for the Souldier to draw out in an inſtant. Laſtly to prevent the many inſolencies and diſorders commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the Sutlers, which he preſumed the Souldiers durſt not do, not the Sutlers ſuffer, the Captains being lodged ſo neer them.</p>
                     <p>You may obſerve, that in this luſt form of Quartering, there are 20 foot of the 200 allowed the Souldiers in depth taken off, and added to the ſtreet between the Captains and the Sutlers; for the ſtreet being in the former Quarter but 20 foot broad, was found to be too narrow for the Waggons, and Carriages to paſs to and fro, which did continually go and come through it with Proviſions for the Army.</p>
                     <p>And whereas in the allowance of 200 foot in depth for the Souldiers, there were but two allotted to lodge or hut together, it happened ſometimes that they came to quarter in places where there was ſmall ſtore of Proviſion to but, withal ſo that the Souldiers could neither fit the ground allotted to them, nor make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny uniform or handſome huts; therefore it was thought fit to take from them the ſaid 20 foot, and to allow them but 180.</p>
                     <p>Note, that the Officers muſt ſee the Souldiers build formally, and that they make their Beds a foot and half or two foot from the ground, to prevent ſickneſs, which they will be ſubject to fall into by lying upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:108706:134"/>Note, that when the Regiment is quartered in one Diviſion, the Colonels Company quarters on the right hand, the Lieutenant-Colonels on the left, the Sergeant-Majors next the Colonel, the eldeſt Captain next him, and ſo all the reſt of the Captains by ſeniority in order from the right hand.</p>
                     <p>But if the Regiment be quartered in two Diviſions, then the Lieutenant-Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels Company quarters on the right hand of the ſecond Diviſion, &amp; the Sergeant-Majors in his place, on the left hand of the firſt, the eldeſt Captain next the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, the ſecond on the left hand of the ſecond Diviſion, the third next the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, the fourth next the Lieutenant-Colonel, the fifth next the third, the ſixth next the fourth in the ſecond Diviſion, and ſo all the reſt of the Captains accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Order: Obſerving (if it may be) that the youngeſt Captain be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways placed next to him that cloſeth the left flank of the ſecond Diviſion.</p>

                     <head>Quartering of Horſe.</head>
                     <p>THe Horſe (unleſs preſſed by an Enemy) are always or moſt commonly quartered in Houſes, both for the commodity of Forrage, and that their Horſes may ſtand under covert; which otherwiſe, by ſtanding three or four nights in rain and cold, would be in danger to be ſpoiled and made unſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>So careful (ſaith <hi>Melzo</hi>) was the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> of his Horſe, that he not only quartered them in Houſes, but made Courts of Guard upon the Avenues and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they watched, to ſhelter them from the weather. But ſeeing they may be ſometimes forced to make Huts, I will ſhew you their manner of Quartering, which is the ſame as the Foot, but that they have more ground allowed them, eſpecially in bredth: for their main ſtreets are twenty foot broad, and the men have ten foot allowed them; whereas the Foot have but eight foot for either Hut: their Horſes are allowed ten foot in bredth, and four in depth: ſo the ground allowed for 100 Horſe, is 300 foot in depth, and 70 in bredth.</p>

But I beleeve it will not be impertinent firſt to give you ſome obſervations conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before, and when you come to fight; as alſo to ſpeak a little of a Chaſe and Retreat.</p>

                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p>IF you be upon Defence, venture not your Game at a caſt; your Enemy can looſe but his Army, you may looſe your Countrey: have a care that you be not forced to fight: hinder him of Proviſion, by cutting off his Convoys, or burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all before him, that he may gather none in the Countrey; uſe ſome means to call him home by diverſion, or wait upon him in places of advantage, as Straits and narrow Paſſages, when he muſt march in ſmall Diviſions, and draw his Troops into ſuch a length that they cannot eaſily ſuccour each other; then find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opportunity, attach him reſolutely; ſo ſhall you be ſure, if he be not a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and expert Captain to do him an affront. Many Examples there are in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, of men that periſhed by preſſing an invading Enemy to fight: the Battails of <hi>Creſſy, Poitiers,</hi> and others, are fair warnings to perſwade men not to preſume, or wilfully to hazard all in one day. Had the Cardinal <hi>Infanta</hi> fought with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> when they were in little <hi>Brabant,</hi> without doubt he had loſt his Country. In a word, if you fight, you ſet your fortune upon the Dice; if you husband your buſineſs warily, the ſtorm will over.</p>
                     <p>If you be an undertaker, the ſooner you bring your Cauſe to trial, the better you are like to ſpeed; delays are dangerous: for change of Air, Diet, and other inconveniencies, may breed ſickneſs and divers ill humors in your Army: and if your Enemy will not fight, but make a <hi>Fabian</hi> or lingring War, he may put you to your ſhifts; therfore firſt acquaint your ſelf with the ſtrength and quality of your Enemies forces, with the ſtate of his Country, with his own diſpoſition, and the diſpoſition of thoſe that are neereſt about him; and before you declare your ſelf gain ſome of his great men (if it be poſſible) to take your part: maintain good Spies in his Court.</p>
                     <p>Forecaſt all that can further or hinder your deſign, before you undertake it; and let your Cauſe be juſt, left you draw the vengeance of God and jealouſie of other Princes upon you. In your preparation, let your firſt care be of the belly: want of Victuals hath been the loſs of many a brave deſign, and the ruine of great Armies. Let your men be well trained, and ſuch as have been uſed to exerciſe and labour (if you can) let them be all of your own Subjects: provide plenty of materials and other neceſſaries for your deſign, and uſe the means to begin your War with ſome notable loſs to your Enemy; ſo ſhall you terrify him, and diſcourage his Allyes and friends from giving him aſſiſtance.</p>

                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:108706:137"/>When you come to fight, chuſe ground (as neer as you can) to fight upon proper for the number and quality of your men: if you be ſtrong in Horſe, chuſe champion; if your ſtrength be on foot, and that you want Horſe, chuſe uneven, buſhy, or incloſed ground, and place ſome Muskettiers in the diſtances between thoſe Troops you have, which may advance, and give fire upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Horſe: if they offer to charge, cover one of your Flanks if you can with ſome River, Moraſs, or Wood. Make your Front ſo large, that your Enemy may not be able with his Wings to charge you in Flank. Let your Battalions be ſmall, as of five or ſix hundred at the moſt, which may nimbly move, charge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, or ſuccour each other at their pleaſures; for great Bodies are unweildy, and being forced to move, cannot keep their order unleſs the ground be very even; for upon uneven ground, they will either fall foul, or be forced to open; and if an Enemy can then make uſe of his advantage, and charge, they are eaſily bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and being broken are irrecoverable; whereas ſmall Troops, although they break, may under the favour and ſuccour of their ſeconds, put themſelves again in order, and be able to do good ſervice.

When you would have the Chaſers retire, let the Drums and Trumpets of thoſe Chaſers that keep their order, ſound the Retreat, that the disbanded Chaſers may know where to find their Troops: and if it be night, let the Drums and Trumpets of the reſt of the Army likewiſe ſound.

                     <head>Of a Retreat.</head>
                     <p>TO make a good Retreat, is one of the Maſter-pieces of a General; nor is it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonorable for him to take the advantage of any time that he finds uſeful for the ſafety of his Army, and good of the Cauſe; although ſome young Souldiers (more hardy then wiſe) think it a diſparagement to retire in the night: but he that will not retire in the night, when reaſon and the benefit of his party doth require, may ſtay and be beaten in the day. Many Examples there are in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of Armies that have been loſt by ſuch gallantry, and their party thereby rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. There is no experienced General ſo indiſcreet or ill adviſed, as to follow a retiring Enemy with his Groſs in the night, eſpecially if he find him retire in good order; for ſo he may be drawn into Ambuſcadoes, or his enemy may wait for him in places of advantage, and do him an affront, and what knows he when he finds the Retreat made orderly, but his Enemy ſeeks to draw him out purpoſely to intrap him? by this means the party retiring may before day get into a place of ſafety; whereas if he retire by day, his Enemy may ſafely follow him with his whole Army, and paſs upon all advantages, whereof he ſhall find plenty in a well-ordered Army, if he know how to make uſe of them, and take his opportunity. I
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:108706:138"/>
therefore conclude, that to retire by night, without ſound of Drum, with match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es covered, or to uſe any other ſecret way to avoid an Enemy when occaſion doth require, is not diſhonorable, but the duty of a good Captain.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, Take from your Scale of equal parts 484, which you ſhall find under <hi>V</hi> in the line of Semi-diameters; and with the length deſcribe the Circle <hi>A F B E;</hi> then take from the ſame Scale 569, which is under <hi>V</hi> in the Line of the interior <hi>Polygon,</hi> and this will reach in the Circle from <hi>B</hi> to <hi>B,</hi> and will divide it into five equal parts; according to the number of Sides of the Fort.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Set off from the Point <hi>B, B I,</hi> equal to 104, which ſhall be the Gorge and Neck: from the point <hi>I</hi> erect two Penpendiculars <hi>I G H,</hi> and <hi>I H</hi> to the line <hi>B B,</hi> making <hi>I H</hi> 87 parts of the Scale, which is in the line under <hi>V,</hi> belonging to the firſt Wing.</p>

                           <head>Of Irregular Fortifications.</head>
                           <p>TOuching Irregular Fortifications, I can give no new Precept; only in the general, it is beſt, if poſſible, to reduce them to regular Forms: but if the place will not permit it, take firſt the Plot of the place, and obſerve what Angles are made between every two ſides thereof.</p>
                           <p>Then look in the Table, in the cell of the Angles of <hi>Polygons,</hi> and ſee what <hi>Polygon</hi> the obſerved Angle comes neereſt to, and make that Baſtion according to the meaſures belonging to that <hi>Polygon,</hi> and ſo of the reſt; ſo ſhall you have unequal Baſtions, but alike defenſible. Wherein likewiſe it is be noted, that if the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108706:142"/>
two ſides of your interior <hi>Polygon</hi> be of unequal length, the Baſtion is beſt framed according to the meaſures taken upon the ſhorter ſide.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Example.</hi> Let it be required to draw Baſtions to the ſide of an inordinate <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagon,</hi> whoſe Angles are, as they are marked in the third Figure.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, I obſerve 134, the Angle comprehended between two of the ſides, comes neereſt to the Angle of an <hi>Octagon</hi> in the Cell of the Angles of <hi>Polygons;</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that Baſtion is to be drawn according to the meaſures belonging to an <hi>Octagon,</hi> taking the meaſures from the ſhorteſt ſide <hi>A B.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now becauſe the meaſures of the <hi>Polygon</hi> interior belong to an <hi>Octagon,</hi> is 614, you muſt make a Scale, of which 614 parts ſhall be equal to <hi>A B;</hi> then ſet off the Neck or Gorge <hi>A E, B E,</hi> 127 ſuch parts, as <hi>A B</hi> is 614; then meaſure 106 for the Wing. Laſtly, becauſe the Center of the Figure is not known, by which the meaſure of the Capital line ſhould be taken, I take the Angle between the Wing prolonged and the Face, and take off 240 ſuch parts as the Curtain is 360, and ſo finiſh the Baſtion belonging to the Angle 134</p>
                           <p>The next Angle 113, which is neereſt to a <hi>Hexagon,</hi> therefore that Baſtion muſt be framed from the ſhorter ſide, according to the meaſures of a <hi>Hexagon;</hi> and ſo muſt all the Angles be fortified by thoſe meaſures which come neereſt to the Angle comprehended between the ſides thereof.</p>
                           <p>But in all Irregular Fortifications, much is attributed to the judgment of the Enginier, either to increaſe or diminiſh the Angles as he finds moſt convenient, but in ſuch manner as the line of defence may ſcoure the face of the Baſtion, and that one part thereof may defend, and be defended by the other.</p>
                           <p>It now remains to treat of the manner of making of Ditches about Forts, of the quantity of earth required to make a Fort, with Walls of any determined breadth and height; as alſo what inclinations they ought to have, both on the inſide and the outſide; within, of that ſloapneſs, that the Souldiers may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty) go up and down; but without, ſloaping ſo little, that they may not be ſcaled by the Enemy; yet ſo much, that the foundation may be ſtrong. But this I ſhall omit for the preſent, my deſign not being to write here all neceſſary to be known in this Art, but only ſo much as might enable the Ingenious Souldier to be able to fortifie any place in the abſence or want of an Enginier.</p>

                  <p>HE that will be a compleat Cannonier, muſt have knowledge and skill in the Sciences <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> and ſome part of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry;</hi> he muſt be able to <hi>Multiply, Divide,</hi> and work the <hi>Golden Rule</hi> both <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Retrograde,</hi> either in <hi>whole Numbers</hi> or <hi>Fractions,</hi> or both. He muſt be ready at the <hi>Extracting</hi> of the <hi>Square</hi> and <hi>Cube Roots,</hi> two of the chief hinges upon which many Queſtions in Gunnery do depend.

                  <p>But it was not intended to make an abſolute or entire Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of this Myſterious Art of Gunnery in this place, but to give the curious (and he that deſires to be an accompliſhed) Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, ſuch ſatisfaction therein, that in the abſence of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneer or Gunner, either by ſickneſs, lameneſs, or by being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by death, the expert Souldier may take upon him the Command of his <hi>Artillery,</hi> to his own Commendations, and for the Honour of the General under whoſe Command ſuch Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is.</p>
                  <p>In order whereunto, I have laid down ſuch Rules and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that the Souldier may ſafely and commendably attempt

                     <head>How to Load any piece of Ordnance both ſurely and fafely.</head>
                     <p>BEfore you load your Piece, take care to cleanſe the Touch-hole, and ſweep the Piece clean within with a dry Lanade or Spunge; then (obſerving the Winde) ſet your Powder-barrel to weather your Piece, and your Linſtock on the contrary. Then filling your Ladle, give it a gentle knock on the foot, that the looſe Corns may ſhake off into the barrel; then put your Ladle into your Piece, and being come to the bottome of the bore, draw it back two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth, and turn it over; then take it out, and with your Rammer (you
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:108706:145"/>
ſtanding on the right ſide of your Piece) ham the Powder cloſe into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Piece, another (in the mean time) holding the Finger or Thumb upon the Touch-hole, that the Powder may not fly out that way: If the Touch-hole be full, it is a ſure ſigh that the Powder is well rammed; and if your Piece be to be charged at twice, you muſt do this after each Ladle-ful.</p>
                     <p>Then take a wiſp of Hey or Straw, and chruſt it hard into the mouth of the Piece after the Powder, that no looſe Corns may remain in the empty part of the <hi>Cylinder,</hi> and ram that ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d home upon the Powder.</p>
                     <p>Then again, take a dry Lanade, and cleanſe the <hi>Cylinder</hi> of the Piece, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oothing be left in the hollow <hi>Cylinder,</hi> to hinder the Bullets way.</p>
                     <p>This done, make your Bullet very clean, that neither Earth nor Sand hang upon it, and put it gently into your Piece, and after it a wad of Hey or Straw eaſily rammed.</p>
                     <p>And here note, that in doing this you muſt not ſtand right before the mouth of your Piece, but on one ſide, for fear of miſchances; and having charged your Piece, you muſt lay your Ladle, Lanade, Scowrer and Rammer on the right ſide of your Piece, the Ladle and Lanade their heads towards the mouth, and the Rammer and Scowrer towards the Breech of the Piece.</p>
                     <p>Your Piece being thus charged, direct her to the intended Mark, and then Prime her; in the doing of which, Firſt, with your Priming-iron enter the Touch-hole, and let your Powder come from the Touch-hole to the Baſe-ring, for there you may fire ſafely; for if you fire at the Touch-hole, your Linſtock may be forced out of your hand: therefore ſome uſe to prime their Gun two or three inches forward off the Touch-hole; for if that be large, the more care muſt be had in firing.</p>
                     <p>In firing of any Piece, take your Linſtock in your right hand, and coming to the ſide of your Piece, ſet forward one Leg, keep your Body upright, and your Arm extended at full length; the cole of your Match being cleared, give fire to the Powder, ſo ſhall you perform your work both ſafely and gracefully.</p>

                     <head>How to Diſpart any Piece of Ordnance.</head>
                     <p>THere are ſeveral ways to diſpart a piece of Ordnance; I will mention one or two in lieu of all the reſt. — Now, to Diſpart a piece, is, <hi>To bring the Metal of the Muzzle-ring, equal to that of the Baſe-ring;</hi> or, it is, <hi>To find the difference of the Metal at the Muzzle and the Baſe-rings.</hi> To effect which, either of theſe wayes will declare.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Take a ſmall ſtreight Stick or Wyer, and put it downright into the Touch-hole of your piece, and even with the top of the Metal of the baſe-ring; this Stick taken out of the Touch-hole, apply to the bottom of the Metal, at the bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e of the piece; and that part of the Stick or Wyer which ſtands above the Metal of the Muzzle-ring, is the true Diſpart for that piece.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Or take with a ſmall ſilk or thred the Circumference of the Metal
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:108706:145"/>
at the baſe-ring; and alſo with another ſilk the Circumference of the Metal at the muzzle-ring divide either of theſe lengths into 22 equal parts, and from each of them cut off ſeven parts; half the difference that is between the length of theſe two ſtrings, is the true Diſpart. This way is in it ſelf exact enough; but I prefer the former far before it, both for eaſe and exactneſs, if carefully hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

                     <p>Place the diſpart upon the top or upper part of the muzzle-ring of your piece perpendicular or upright, fixing it there with wax or the like: then going to the breech of your Gun, cauſe one of your Matroſſes with a leaver to turn the piece towards the mark: then the carriage there ſtanding, cauſe him to raiſe the piece or depreſs it, till with your eye (at about 2 or 3 foot diſtance from the breech of your piece) you can ſee the very top or higheſt part of the Metal of the baſe-ring, the very top of your diſpart, and the mark you are to ſhoot at, all three in a right line; which when you have found, cauſe the piece to be kept there by, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Coyn under it; and when it is coyned, look again, and ſee if all be as you before left it; if it be not, cauſe it to be altered: but if it be you may, prime and give fire.</p>

                     <head>The firſt Shot being defective, how to amend it in the ſecond.</head>
                     <p>A Shot is ſaid to be defective, when it is either over, under, or wide of the mark aimed at: to remedy this, you muſt obſerve theſe few Directions following:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If your Shot be right to your Mark, but yet over, it is a ſign your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpart is too ſhort, which you may remedy by placing a diſpart upon the muzzle-ring of ſuch a length, that looking by the baſe-ring and the mark the ſhot laſt made, you may ſee the top of the diſpart: with this new diſpart level your piece to the mark, prime and give fire, and doubtleſs your ſhot will prove good.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If your Shot be juſt under the mark, then look how much the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part is over the Mark of the Shot laſt made, and cut it ſo much ſhorter, that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the breech of the Piece, you ſee the mark of the laſt Shot, and the top of the diſpart in one right line; then by this diſpart level your Gun to the Mark, and give fire.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, But if your firſt Shot had been level with, but yet to the right hand of the Mark; to remedy this, ſtand at the breech of the piece, looking over the diſpart at the mark the laſt Shot made, and upon that part of the baſe-ring, which you then look over, ſet up a pin with a little wax; ſo this pin will be in a right line with the diſpart and Mark of the Shot: then level the piece again, by help of this pin and the diſpart, to your aſſigned Mark, and without Queſtion you will make an effectual ſhot.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, But if your ſhot be both wide, and too high, or too low, then both the former rules muſt be applied to regulate it, which reaſon will beſt direct how to perform.</p>
                     <p>And here note, that theſe defective Shots laſt ſpoken of, are not, or may not be in the fault of the Gunner; for let him diſpart and level his Gun never ſo well,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:108706:146"/>
he may make a bad Shot; for, 1. The Wind may alter the Range of the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. 2. The irregularity or inequality of the thickneſs of the Metal of the piece may much impede. 3. The uneven lying of the piece in the Carriage; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reaſons not here to be enumerated.</p>

Then (though your Gun be moved out of its place, yet) you may in the darkeſt night (by help of a dark Lanthorn) bring your piece to the former poſition; which being primed and fired, will doubtleſs come neer, if not hit the Mark.</p>

                        <p>Your piece being charged, let it be laid in the Carriage at little or no eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it may ſhoot about breſt-high; then diſpart it, and direct it againſt ſome Mark that lies juſt in the way they are to paſs: if the ground they are to paſs be higher then your platform, mount your Gun accordingly; if lower, depreſs it; if level, then as before: your Gun thus prepared, in their paſſage you may give fire at pleaſure: and in the ordering of your Gun for this Stratagem, let it (if poſſible) be parallel with the plain of the Horizon, that ſo it may ſhoot ſhort, eſpecially if the place be ſtony; for the grazing of the bullet among the ſtones, may do more execution then the ſhot it ſelf: but above all, have a ſpecial care you ſhoot not wide nor over.</p>
                        <p>What hath been ſaid concerning an Enemies paſſing by Land, the like may be done by an Enemies Ship ſayling along a River.

Thoſe for Bridges are commonly eleven inches long, and at the breech ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven inches and an half about, and five inches wide within: the Metal at the breech muſt be one inch and a quarter thick, and at the neck half an inch thick, beſides the muzzle-ring. The mouth muſt be ten inches wide, and to the Touch-hole muſt be added a pipe, as in the Figure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort for Gates with Perculles, muſt be nine inches long, almoſt half an inch thick at the neck, and an inch thick at the breech; the mouth muſt be about ſeven inches wide, and the outſide of the breech muſt be ſix inches wide, and the inſide four inches.</p>

                     <p>The Charges for theſe Petards are to be of the fineſt powder that can be got, beaten hard into the Petard, yet not to break the Gun; then muſt it be ſtopped cloſe in with a Wooden board of about an Inch thick; juſtly fitted thereunto, with wax melted to ſtop the creviſe about to keep out water. You muſt not charge it up to the top, but leave the breadth of almoſt two inches empty, which muſt be filled up with tow cloſe ſtopped in, and a linnen Cloath bound about the Petards neck to keep it cloſe in.</p>
                     <p>The Touch-hole muſt be ſtopped with a Cork, and over that a Sear-Cloath to keep it from wet.</p>
                     <p>The charge for the greater ſort of Petards, is five or ſix pound of powder. Thoſe of the ſecond, from three to four pounds. And for the ſmalleſt, from one pound and an half to one pound.</p>
